name: Event Data Deploy

# Triggered when a PR targeting main contains changes to event data files.
# Applies only to PRs from event/ (add-event) and event-edit/ (edit-event) branches.
#
# Four sequential jobs:
#   1. lint-yaml      – structural validation of the changed YAML file
#   2. security-check – injection scan and link protocol validation
#   3. build          – full site build; captures the 4 event-data pages as an artefact
#   4. ftp-deploy     – uploads only those 4 files to FTP (no clean-slate)
