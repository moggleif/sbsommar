# SB Sommar – Event Handling User Requirements

This document describes what users must be able to do regarding activities and the weekly schedule.

It focuses strictly on user needs and expected behavior.

## 1. Viewing the Schedule

Participants must be able to:

- View the full weekly schedule (Sunday–Sunday).

- See activities listed in chronological order.

In schedule views, each activity must display:

- Title
- Start time

The day is used for placement in the weekly structure, not for display inside each activity row.

The schedule must be quick to scan and easy to understand.

Participants must be able to click an activity to see more information.

The detail view must include:

- Title
- Date

- Optional communication link

If no communication link exists, no link section should be shown.

Users should clearly understand whether additional information exists beyond the schedule row.

- Avoid unnecessary complexity.

The purpose is coordination, not administration.
