## 28. Progressive Web App (PWA)

The site is installable as a Progressive Web App. This gives participants a
native-app-like experience when they add sbsommar.se to their home screen,
including offline access to cached pages and event data.

### Manifest

`source/static/app.webmanifest` defines the app name, icons, theme color, and
display mode. It is copied to `public/app.webmanifest` during the build.

### Service worker

`source/static/sw.js` lives at the site root (`public/sw.js`) so its scope
covers all pages. It uses a versioned cache name (currently `sb-sommar-v6`).

**Scheme guard:** The fetch handler returns early for any request whose
URL scheme is not `http:` or `https:`. This prevents errors from
browser-extension schemes such as `chrome-extension:`.

**Cache strategy:**

| Request type | Strategy | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML (navigation) | Network-first, cache fallback (ignoreSearch) | Users should see fresh content when online |
| CSS, JS, images | Cache-first (exact match), network fallback | Static assets are served by cache-busted URL; exact match ensures a new hash triggers a fresh network fetch |
| `events.json` | Network-first, cache fallback (ignoreSearch) | Event data should be fresh when online but available offline |
| API calls (`/api/`, `/add-event`, `/edit-event`) | Network-only (not cached) | Mutations must always reach the server |

Cache-matching for the network-first strategies (HTML and `events.json`)
uses `{ ignoreSearch: true }` so that cache-busted or query-stringed
URLs still match the pre-cached file when falling back offline. The
cache-first strategy for static assets does **not** use `ignoreSearch`
— a request for `style.css?v=<newHash>` must not satisfy from a cache
entry keyed at `style.css?v=<oldHash>` (§96.5).

**Offline fallback:** When a navigation request fails and the requested
page is not in the cache, the service worker responds with
`/offline.html` — a pre-cached page that tells the user they are offline.

**Build-time pre-cache manifest (§92):**

The build scans all files in `public/` after post-processing and injects
a complete pre-cache URL list into `sw.js` by replacing the
`/* __PRE_CACHE_URLS__ */` placeholder. This ensures every asset — HTML
pages, CSS, JS, images, `events.json` — is available offline from the
first launch. Files excluded from pre-cache: `.htaccess`, `robots.txt`,
`sw.js`, `version.json`, `.ics`, `.rss`, and per-event detail pages.

**Lifecycle (§96 — self-healing upgrade):**

- `install`: Calls `self.skipWaiting()` and pre-caches all assets from
  the build-injected list. Each URL is wrapped in
  `new Request(url, { cache: 'reload' })` so the fetch bypasses the
  browser's HTTP cache. This prevents a stale HTTP-cache entry (kept
  fresh for up to a week by `Cache-Control: max-age=604800`) from being
  copied into the new service-worker cache on install.
- `activate`: Deletes every cache whose name does not match the current
  `CACHE_NAME`, then calls `self.clients.claim()` so the new worker
  immediately controls every open tab without waiting for the user to
  close and reopen them.
- `fetch`: Intercepts requests and applies the strategy table above.

Combined, `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim` + `cache: 'reload'` on
pre-cache mean that any client whose prior service worker had cached a
stale `/style.css` self-heals on the first post-deploy visit: the
browser fetches the new `sw.js` (bypassing its HTTP cache because
`updateViaCache: 'imports'` is Chrome's default for registered service
workers), installs it, activates it immediately, wipes the old cache,
and rebuilds the new cache from network-only responses.

**Offline guard (§92):**

Form pages (`lagg-till.html`, `redigera.html`) and the feedback modal
include offline detection. When the user is offline, a Swedish-language
banner appears and submit buttons are disabled. When connectivity
returns, the banner disappears and buttons are re-enabled.
`offline-guard.js` handles the form pages; `feedback.js` handles the
feedback modal internally.

### Registration

`source/assets/js/client/sw-register.js` registers the service worker on every
page. It checks for `navigator.serviceWorker` support before registering.

### HTML head tags

Every render function adds to `<head>`:

- `<link rel="manifest" href="app.webmanifest">`
- `<meta name="theme-color" content="...">` (terracotta from design palette)
- `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">`
- `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="default">`
- `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="images/sbsommar-icon-192.png">`

### Icons

Two PNG icons are required in `source/content/images/`:

| File | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sbsommar-icon-192.png` | 192×192 | Android home screen, Apple touch icon |
| `sbsommar-icon-512.png` | 512×512 | Android splash screen |

### Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `source/static/app.webmanifest` | PWA manifest |
| `source/static/sw.js` | Service worker |
| `source/assets/js/client/sw-register.js` | Service worker registration |
| `source/build/render-offline.js` | Offline fallback page renderer |
| `source/content/images/sbsommar-icon-192.png` | App icon 192×192 |
| `source/content/images/sbsommar-icon-512.png` | App icon 512×512 |
| `source/assets/js/client/pwa-install.js` | PWA install button logic |
| `source/assets/js/client/offline-guard.js` | Offline detection for form pages |

### 28.7 Install guide

A discreet install button in the site header helps users discover that the
site can be installed as an app. The button appears alongside the existing
header controls (hamburger menu, scroll-to-top, feedback).

**Platform detection and behaviour:**

| Platform | Detection | Button action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome / Edge (Android, desktop) | `beforeinstallprompt` event fires | Captures event; click calls `prompt()` on the deferred event |
| iOS Safari | UA contains iPhone/iPad + no `beforeinstallprompt` | Click shows tooltip with manual instruction |
| Standalone mode | `matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')` | Button not rendered |
| Other browsers | Neither condition met | Button not rendered |

After successful installation (`appinstalled` event), the button is hidden.

The iOS tooltip provides a Swedish instruction ("Tryck på Dela-ikonen och
välj 'Lägg till på hemskärmen'") and closes on outside click or Escape.

All logic lives in `source/assets/js/client/pwa-install.js`, loaded with
`defer` on every page via the shared layout.

## 30. Admin Token Infrastructure

### Purpose

A lightweight admin mechanism allows designated administrators to bypass
the per-event cookie ownership model. The token infrastructure covers
storage, activation, verification, and status display. The edit/delete
endpoints and client-side code accept a valid admin token as an
alternative to session-cookie ownership (OR condition).

### Token storage (server)

Admin tokens are stored in the environment variable `ADMIN_TOKENS` as a
comma-separated list of opaque strings (e.g. UUIDs). Both the Node.js
server (`app.js`) and the PHP API (`api/`) read this variable at startup.
When the variable is unset or empty, all admin functionality is disabled.

### Verification endpoint

`POST /verify-admin` accepts `{ "token": "<string>" }` and responds:

- `200 { "valid": true }` — token found in `ADMIN_TOKENS`
- `403 { "valid": false }` — token not found

The comparison uses constant-time string comparison to prevent timing
attacks.

### Token storage (client)

The admin token is stored in `localStorage` under the key `sb_admin`:

```json
{ "token": "<string>", "activated": 1710000000000 }
```

The token is never placed in a cookie. It is sent explicitly in API
request bodies when admin privileges are needed.

### Expiry

A token is considered expired if more than 30 days (2 592 000 000 ms)
have passed since the `activated` timestamp. Expiry is checked
client-side. An expired token behaves as if no token exists.

### Activation page

`/admin.html` — a minimal page with a text input and submit button.
On submit, it calls `POST /verify-admin`. If valid, the token and
timestamp are stored in `localStorage`. The page shares the site layout
(header, navigation, footer) but is **not listed in the navigation**.

### Footer status indicator

A small icon in the shared site footer shows admin status:

| State | Display |
| --- | --- |
| No token in `localStorage` | Nothing shown |
| Valid token (< 30 days) | Filled/locked icon with title "Admin aktiv" |
| Expired token (> 30 days) | Open/unlocked icon with title "Admin utgången", links to `/admin.html` |

The icon is rendered client-side by a script included in the footer
layout, reading from `localStorage`.

### Files (planned)

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/render-admin.js` | Build-time render of `/admin.html` |
| `source/assets/js/client/admin.js` | Client-side: activation form + footer icon |
| `source/build/layout.js` | Updated `pageFooter()` to include admin icon container |
| `app.js` | New `POST /verify-admin` endpoint (Node.js) |
| `api/index.php` | New `POST /verify-admin` endpoint (PHP) |

## 31. Authorization Endpoint Rate Limiting

### 31.1 Goal

Protect authorization and write endpoints (`/verify-admin`,
`/edit-event`, `/delete-event`, `/feedback`) from brute-force probing
and abusive bursts, and give CodeQL's `js/missing-rate-limiting`
analysis a visible, explicit counter to stop flagging these handlers.

The mechanism is intentionally minimal: a per-IP counter per endpoint
with an hourly window, returned as HTTP `429` with a Swedish error
message. Coordination across processes is out of scope — single-process
Node and single-host PHP both store counter state locally.

### 31.2 Per-endpoint limits

| Endpoint          | Limit (per IP per hour) | Rationale                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `/verify-admin`   | 5                       | Brute-force target; admins only verify once per session |
| `/edit-event`     | 30                      | Normal owner edits; 2–3 attempts per edit, batching tolerated |
| `/delete-event`   | 30                      | Same profile as edit                                |
| `/feedback`       | 5                       | Existing §73.14 limit, unchanged                    |

The rate-limit check runs **before** validation, authorization, and
time-gating, so a throttled client never reaches the admin-token
comparison path or the GitHub API.

### 31.3 Node (`app.js` + `express-rate-limit`)

- Uses the [`express-rate-limit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)
  middleware, installed as a runtime dependency.
- Each guarded route has its own `rateLimit({ windowMs, limit, ... })`
  instance defined at the top of `app.js`; the instance is applied as
  per-route middleware. Separate instances keep per-endpoint counters
  independent.
- State: the middleware's default in-memory store. Expired entries are
  cleaned up automatically; no unbounded growth.
- Client IP resolution: `express-rate-limit` derives the key from
  `req.ip`, which honours the Express `trust proxy` setting. `app.js`
  sets `app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback')` so only loopback-connected
  reverse proxies are permitted to set `X-Forwarded-For`. Deployments
  behind a non-loopback proxy are expected to configure an appropriate
  trust boundary in their reverse-proxy layer.
- On limit exceeded, the middleware emits HTTP `429` with the standard
  `Retry-After` and `RateLimit-*` headers; `app.js` overrides the
  response body via the `handler` option to produce the Swedish error
  payload defined in §31.5.

### 31.4 PHP (`api/src/RateLimit.php`)

- Exposes `SBSommar\RateLimit::isLimited(string $ip, string $namespace,
  int $limit, int $windowSeconds): bool`.
- State: a single JSON file under `sys_get_temp_dir()`
  (`sbsommar_rate_limit.json`), with namespaced keys so endpoints share
  storage but not quotas.
- The same expired-entry sweep runs each call; no scheduled cleanup.
- Client IP resolution is handled by `api/index.php`: `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`
  → `REMOTE_ADDR`.

### 31.5 Failure semantics

On limit exceeded, both runtimes return:

```json
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json

{ "success": false, "error": "För många förfrågningar. Försök igen senare." }
```

`/verify-admin` returns the same payload but omits `success` since its
success response uses `{ "valid": true }` — it returns
`{ "error": "För många förfrågningar. Försök igen senare." }` with
status `429` and no `valid` key.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.js`                      | Defines per-endpoint `rateLimit()` middleware and applies it to routes |
| `package.json`                | Declares `express-rate-limit` as a runtime dependency               |
| `api/src/RateLimit.php`       | Shared PHP helper                                                   |
| `api/src/Feedback.php`        | Uses shared PHP helper                                              |
| `api/index.php`               | Calls helper at the top of each guarded handler                     |

### 31.7 Known limitations

- In-process counters reset on restart. Acceptable because both
  deployments are single-process and an attacker would need to time
  restarts very precisely.
- Node's `trust proxy` is set to `'loopback'`. Deployments that place
  a non-loopback reverse proxy in front of `app.js` must widen the
  trust setting or accept that `X-Forwarded-For` will not be honoured
  for rate-limit keying. The PHP handler continues to trust
  `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` as-is, matching the hosting-environment
  assumption for shared PHP hosts.
- File locking is not used in PHP. Two concurrent PHP requests may
  race on the JSON write; worst case is one request's increment lost.
  For a 5/h or 30/h limit this is negligible.

## 33. Regex Performance and Escape Hygiene

### 33.1 Goal

Close CodeQL alerts #17 (`js/polynomial-redos`) and #30–#32
(`js/incomplete-sanitization`) and remove two regex patterns that invite
future bugs: a polynomial-time trim in the slug builder and an
incomplete ad-hoc escape in a test file. The fixes are behaviour-
preserving; nothing user-facing or data-facing changes.

### 33.2 `slugify()` — linear-time trim

`slugify()` in `source/api/github.js` runs on user-supplied activity
titles. Before this change the trim step used two separate passes:

```js
.replace(/^-+/, '')
.replace(/-+$/, '')
```

`/^-+/` is linear (anchored at start), but `/-+$/` without a start
anchor can be O(n²) when the input contains a long run of `-`
characters: the engine retries the `-+$` match at every position. After
the earlier collapse `[^a-z0-9]+/g → '-'`, runs of `-` already cannot
exceed length 1, so `+` in the trim regexes is redundant. The fix is a
single combined pass:

```js
.replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
```

Linear, matches at most two characters (one leading, one trailing), and
produces identical output for every input.

### 33.3 `tests/helpers/regex-escape.js` — shared `escapeRegExp`

`tests/scoped-headings.test.js` built a `RegExp` from a CSS selector
string by escaping only `.` and `\s`, which is fine for the current
literals (`.md-preview`, `.event-desc`, `.event-description`) but
malformed as soon as any callsite passes a selector with `*`, `+`, `?`,
`^`, `$`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `|`, `[`, `]`, or `\`. CodeQL's
`js/incomplete-sanitization` correctly flags this pattern.

A single helper at `tests/helpers/regex-escape.js` exports the canonical
escape:

```js
function escapeRegExp(str) {
  return String(str).replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
}
```

`tests/scoped-headings.test.js` imports this helper at each site where a
`container` or `heading` value is interpolated into a `RegExp`. No
other test file currently builds a pattern from a variable string, so
no broader refactor is needed.
