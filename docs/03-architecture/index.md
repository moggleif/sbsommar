# SB Sommar – Architecture Overview

This project is a static, YAML-driven camp platform with a small API server for live event submissions. Two API implementations exist: a Node.js version (`app.js`) for local development and Node.js-capable hosts, and a PHP version (`api/`) for shared hosting environments (e.g. Loopia) that do not support Node.js.

The system is intentionally simple:

- No database
- No CMS
- No server-side rendering — HTML is generated at build time
- Git is the archive

Architecture is split across topic files for readability. Section IDs (`03-§N.M`) are stable strings cited from source code, tests, and `99-traceability.md` — the ID does not encode the file path, so a section can be moved between files without breaking references.

Looking for `03-§N`? Search this directory: `grep -l '## N\.' docs/03-architecture/*.md` finds the file that owns the section. Two `§11` headings exist (a pre-existing irregularity, preserved during the split): "Event Data CI Pipeline" lives in `ci-and-deploy.md`, "Design Philosophy" lives in `appendix.md`.
