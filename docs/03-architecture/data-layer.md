# SB Sommar – Architecture: Data Layer

Camp YAML files, the central metadata registry, active-camp resolution, the archive layer, the shared footer, and search-engine blocking.

Part of [the architecture index](./index.md). Section IDs (`03-§N.M`) are stable and cited from code; they do not encode the file path.

---

## 1. Data Layer

Each camp has exactly one YAML file in `source/data/`:

```text
source/data/2025-06-syssleback.yaml
source/data/2025-08-syssleback.yaml
source/data/2026-06-syssleback.yaml
```

Each file contains:

- Camp metadata (name, dates, location)
- A list of events

Events are unique on the combination of `(title + date + start)`.

This is the single source of truth for all camp content.

---

## 2. Metadata Layer

`source/data/camps.yaml` is the central registry of all camps, past and present.

It contains:

- All camps (active, archived, and upcoming)
- Their date ranges
- Which file contains their events
- Which camp is currently active

Example entry:

```yaml
camps:
  - id: 2026-06-syssleback
    name: SB Sommar Juni 2026
    start_date: 2026-06-28
    end_date: 2026-07-05
    file: 2026-06-syssleback.yaml
    archived: false
```

The site never hardcodes file names. It always reads from `camps.yaml` first.

The active camp is **derived at build time and API request time** — there is
no manual `active` flag. The derivation rules (in priority order):

1. **On dates** — today falls within `start_date..end_date` (inclusive).
2. **Next upcoming** — nearest future `start_date`.
3. **Most recent** — latest `end_date`, even if archived.

If two camps overlap, the one with the earlier `start_date` wins.

The derivation logic lives in `source/scripts/resolve-active-camp.js` and is
shared by `build.js` and the API (`github.js`).

### QA camp isolation

Camps may have an optional `qa: true` field. QA camps are filtered based on
the `BUILD_ENV` environment variable:

- **Production** (`BUILD_ENV=production`): QA camps are excluded from
  the camps array at the top of `build.js`, before the array is passed
  to `resolveActiveCamp()` or any rendering function. This ensures QA
  camps never appear in production output (schedule, index camp list,
  archive, RSS, calendar, or API responses).
- **QA** (`BUILD_ENV=qa`): QA camps that are on dates take priority over
  non-QA camps, ensuring the QA camp is always active in QA.
- **Local** (`BUILD_ENV` unset): No filtering — all camps are included
  and normal derivation rules apply.

Two QA-only camps coexist in `camps.yaml` to provide a continuous QA
testing window without overlapping the real-camp season:

- A spring QA camp (`qa-thisweek`) runs through the off-season and
  closes two weeks before the next real camp's `start_date`, leaving
  the real-camp window QA-free.
- An autumn QA camp (`qa-testcamp`) covers October 1 through December
  31 of the current year, reopening QA testing once the real-camp
  season ends.

See `02-requirements/event-data.md §42` for the full data model and seasonal rules.

## 3. Active Camp and Event Submissions

During camp week, participants submit activities through the `/lagg-till.html` form.

The API server (`app.js`) handles each submission as follows:

1. Validates the incoming event data, including security scanning for injection patterns and link protocol validation (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11.8).
2. Responds immediately with a success confirmation — the form does not wait for the rest of the process.
3. Reads `source/data/camps.yaml` from GitHub via the Contents API.
4. Derives the active camp from dates and reads its YAML file from GitHub.
5. Appends the new event and commits it to a temporary branch. The serialised YAML block is indented to match the existing `events:` list so the file remains valid YAML.
6. Opens a pull request with auto-merge enabled.
7. The event data PR check (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11) runs — a no-op that satisfies branch protection.
8. The PR merges automatically via auto-merge.
9. The post-merge event data deploy workflow (see [`ci-and-deploy.md`](./ci-and-deploy.md) §11) installs production dependencies via `setup-node` + `npm ci --omit=dev`, builds the site, and uploads event-data pages to QA and Production.

The updated schedule is visible to participants within minutes of submission.

The active camp's YAML file is always version-controlled. Git history provides a full audit trail of every event submitted through the form.

    end
```

### 3.1 Batch event submissions (recurring activities)

A batch endpoint `POST /add-events` (Node.js) and `POST /api/add-events` (PHP)
accepts the same fields as the single-event endpoint but with `dates` (an array)
instead of `date`. <!-- 03-§3.1 -->

The flow is identical to the single-event flow above, with two differences:

1. **Validation**: every date in the array is validated against camp range,
   past-date rules, and uniqueness `(title + date + start)` before any write.
   If any date fails, the entire batch is rejected. <!-- 03-§3.1a -->
2. **Commit**: all events are appended to the camp YAML file and committed in a
   single branch and PR — not one PR per event. <!-- 03-§3.1b -->

The session cookie is updated with all new event IDs (when consent is given).

### 3.2 Day grid on add-activity form

The add-activity form replaces the native `<input type="date">` with a grid of
day buttons rendered at build time from the active camp's `start_date` and
`end_date`. <!-- 03-§3.2 -->

Each button shows the Swedish weekday abbreviation and date (e.g. "Mån 28/7").
A "Återkommande" toggle switches the grid between single-select (default) and
multi-select mode. In single-select, exactly one day is selected. In
multi-select, multiple days can be toggled on/off. <!-- 03-§3.2a -->

Client-side date filtering: when today falls within the camp period, only days
from today onward are shown. This uses the same date comparison logic as the
existing past-date blocking ([`forms-and-api.md`](./forms-and-api.md) §13). <!-- 03-§3.2b -->

### 3.3 API error classification

When a GitHub API call fails during event submission (add, batch-add, or edit),
the PHP API classifies the error before returning it to the client. <!-- 03-§3.3 -->

| HTTP status from GitHub | Category | Swedish user message | Actionable? |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 401 / 403 (no rate-limit) | Auth | Servern kunde inte ansluta till GitHub. Kontakta arrangören. | No — config |
| 403 (rate-limit) / 429 | Rate limit | För många förfrågningar just nu. Försök igen om några minuter. | Yes — wait |
| 409 / 422 | Conflict | En skrivkonflikt uppstod. Försök igen. | Yes — retry |
| 5xx | GitHub error | GitHub har tillfälliga problem. Försök igen om en stund. | Yes — wait |
| curl timeout / no response | Network | Kunde inte nå GitHub. Kontrollera att tjänsten är tillgänglig. | Maybe |
| Other | Unknown | Ett oväntat fel uppstod. Försök igen eller kontakta arrangören. | Maybe |

The classification is implemented in a single helper method so all three
mutation endpoints share the same logic. Error messages never expose tokens,
file paths, or stack traces. <!-- 03-§3.3a -->

## 4. Archive Layer

After camp ends:

1. Set `archived: true` for the camp in `source/data/camps.yaml`.
2. Commit the change — the YAML file becomes the permanent archive.
3. Deploy. The system automatically derives the next active camp from dates.

No data is ever lost.

---

## 4a. Archive Page Rendering

At build time, `source/build/render-arkiv.js` produces `public/arkiv.html`.

Data sources:

- `camps.yaml` — camp metadata (name, dates, location, information, link).
- Per-camp event YAML files (referenced via the `file:` field in `camps.yaml`) —
  event data for the event list inside each accordion panel.

Steps:

1. Filter `camps` to those with `archived: true`.
2. Sort descending by `start_date` (newest first).
3. For each archived camp, load its event YAML file (via the `file:` field in
   `camps.yaml`) and pass the events array to the template.
4. Render a vertical timeline: each camp is one `<li>` in an `<ol class="timeline">`.
5. Each timeline item contains:
   - A `<button>` accordion header showing the camp name, with date range and
     location in subdued text to the right.
   - A hidden `<div>` panel with:
     - Facebook logo link (if `link` is non-empty), using the image at
       `images/facebook-ikon.webp`.
     - Camp metadata (dates, location).
     - Information paragraph (if non-empty).
     - Event list grouped by day, using the same row format as the schedule page.
6. The panel is hidden/shown by toggling `aria-expanded` and `hidden` via
   `source/assets/js/client/arkiv.js` — no framework.
7. Only one panel may be open at a time; the JS closes any previously open panel
   before opening the new one.
8. The JS toggles a CSS class on the active timeline dot to highlight the
   selected camp on the timeline.

### Fields used from `camps.yaml`

| Field | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Accordion header (primary text) |
| `start_date` | Date range display; sort key; header metadata |
| `end_date` | Date range display; header metadata |
| `location` | Header metadata (gray text); location line in panel |
| `information` | Information paragraph (omitted if empty) |
| `link` | Facebook logo link (omitted if empty) |
| `file` | Path to per-camp event YAML for event list |

Dates are formatted in Swedish: `D månadsnamn YYYY` (e.g. "22 juni 2025").

### Archive page files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Renders `public/arkiv.html` at build time |
| `source/assets/js/client/arkiv.js` | Accordion open/close + ARIA state on the archive page |

### Archive page changes to existing files

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/build.js` | Call `renderArkivPage(camps)` and write `public/arkiv.html` |
| `source/build/layout.js` | Add "Arkiv" nav link |

---

## 4b. Shared Site Footer

Every page produced by the build includes a `<footer class="site-footer">` element
at the bottom of `<body>`.

### Content source

Footer content lives in `source/content/footer.md`. Non-technical contributors
can edit this file to change the footer on all pages without touching any template
or render function.

### Build-time rendering

`source/build/build.js`:

1. Reads `source/content/footer.md` at the start of the build, before rendering
   any page.
2. Converts the Markdown to HTML using `convertMarkdown()` from
   `source/build/render-index.js` (powered by the `marked` library; the same
   pipeline used for homepage sections).
3. If the file does not exist, `footerHtml` is set to an empty string — no error,
   no crash.
4. Passes `footerHtml` as an argument to every render function.

### Render functions

Each render function (`renderSchedulePage`, `renderTodayPage`, `renderIdagPage`,
`renderAddPage`, `renderEditPage`, `renderArkivPage`, `renderIndexPage`) accepts
`footerHtml` as its last argument. It calls `pageFooter(footerHtml)` from
`source/build/layout.js` and places the result immediately before `</body>`.

`pageFooter(footerHtml)`:

- Returns `<footer class="site-footer">…</footer>` when `footerHtml` is non-empty.
- Returns an empty string when `footerHtml` is empty (file-missing fallback).

### No duplication

No render function contains literal footer text. The Markdown file is the single
source of truth. Updating `footer.md` and rebuilding changes the footer on every
page simultaneously.

### Files changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/content/footer.md` | New file — footer content in Markdown |
| `source/build/layout.js` | Add `pageFooter(footerHtml)` |
| `source/build/build.js` | Load `footer.md`, convert to HTML, pass to all render calls |
| `source/build/render.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-today.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-idag.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-add.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-edit.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/build/render-index.js` | Accept `footerHtml`; inject via `pageFooter()` |
| `source/assets/cs/style.css` | Add `.site-footer` styles |

## 4c. Search Engine and Crawler Blocking

The site is intentionally hidden from search engines. Two mechanisms enforce this:

### robots.txt

`source/build/build.js` writes `public/robots.txt` during the build:

```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

This tells well-behaved crawlers not to index any page.

### Meta robots tag

Every HTML page includes a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag
in its `<head>` section. This is the browser-level signal that reinforces
`robots.txt` for crawlers that follow the meta tag standard.

Each render function (`renderSchedulePage`, `renderTodayPage`, `renderIdagPage`,
`renderAddPage`, `renderEditPage`, `renderArkivPage`, `renderIndexPage`) emits
the tag as part of its `<head>` block.

### Crawler-blocking files changed

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `source/build/build.js` | Write `public/robots.txt` during build |
| `source/build/render.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-today.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-idag.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-add.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-edit.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-arkiv.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
| `source/build/render-index.js` | Add `<meta name="robots">` to `<head>` |
