# Requirements Traceability Matrix – SB Sommar

## What is this document?

A requirements traceability matrix answers three questions for every requirement:

1. **Is it documented?** Where does the requirement come from?
2. **Is it implemented?** Which code makes it work?
3. **Is it verified?** Which test proves it works?

When a requirement has no test, it may be broken without anyone noticing.
When a requirement has no implementation, it is a gap — a feature that is missing.
This document makes those gaps visible so they can be planned and prioritised.

## How to read the columns

### ID

A short, stable reference you can use in issues, pull requests, and commit messages.
For example: `"this PR closes 02-§9.5"`.

The ID appears in **two places**: in this matrix (the per-family table file in this folder —
here, [02-requirements.md](./02-requirements.md)), and inline in the source document next to the
requirement text as an HTML comment. To find requirement `02-§9.5`, search for `02-§9.5` in the
matching per-family file or anywhere under `docs/02-requirements/` — it will appear on the line
that says `` `location` is present and non-empty ``.

Format: `{doc}-§{section}.{counter}`

- `02` = the document family the requirement comes from (`02-requirements/`)
- `§9` = the section number inside that family (matches the `## 9.` heading in the topic file that owns §9)
- `.5` = a sequential counter within that section (labels are added top-to-bottom)

The section prefix tells you *which document owns the requirement* and therefore where to look
if you want to read the surrounding context or open a discussion about changing it.
When adding a new requirement to a section, give it the next available number in that section
and add the `<!-- {id} -->` comment to the source doc alongside the entry in this matrix.

Examples:

- `02-§4.2` = second requirement from §4 of `02-requirements/` (lives in the topic file that owns §4)
- `05-§4.1` = first requirement from §4 of `05-DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- `CL-§5.3` = third requirement from §5 of `CLAUDE.md`

The documents requirements are drawn from:

| Prefix | Document |
| --- | --- |
| `02` | `docs/02-requirements/` — what the site must do and for whom (split across topic files; see the index for the redirect map) |
| `05` | `docs/05-DATA_CONTRACT.md` — YAML schema and validation rules |
| `07` | `docs/07-design/` — visual design, CSS tokens, accessibility |
| `CL` | `CLAUDE.md` — architectural constraints and quality requirements |

### Requirement

One sentence describing a single, testable thing the system must do.
"Single" matters — if a sentence could be split into two independently verifiable things, it should be.

### Doc Ref

This is **not** where the requirement is stated — it is where the *solution approach* is documented.
It points to the doc that tells a developer *how* to implement the requirement.

Example: the requirement "event date must fall within camp dates" comes from `02-requirements/add-edit-forms.md §9`,
but the implementation rules (date format, range check) are specified in `06-EVENT_DATA_MODEL.md §4`,
so that is the Doc Ref.

A `—` here means no implementation guidance has been written yet.
That is itself a gap worth noting.

### Test(s)

Short IDs that point to tests in the `tests/` directory.
The full mapping from ID to file and describe-suite is in the **Test ID Legend** at the bottom.

Examples:

- `VLD-04..11` = tests VLD-04 through VLD-11 in `tests/validate.test.js`
- `SNP-01` = first test in `tests/snapshot.test.js`

Tests are listed **before** Implementation to reflect the intended order of work:
write the test first, then write the code that makes it pass.

A `—` here means no automated test exists for this requirement.

### Implementation

The file(s) and function(s) in the codebase where the requirement is satisfied.
A `—` means nothing has been built yet.
Notes in parentheses explain partial or incorrect implementations.

### Status

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `covered` | Code exists **and** a test verifies it |
| `implemented` | Code exists, but no automated test |
| `gap` | The requirement has no implementation (and no test) |

`implemented` is not the same as `covered`. Code that is not tested may break silently.
Aim to move all `implemented` rows toward `covered` over time.

### Archived (superseded) requirements

Rows in the per-family files marked **superseded by 02-§X** describe requirements
whose prose has been moved to `docs/02-requirements/archive.md`. The IDs are kept verbatim because
they are still cited from code and from this matrix; the moved prose is preserved
there for historical context. Refer to that file for the current list of archived
ID ranges.

## Traceability tables

The matrix is split by ID family. Each file carries the rows for one family.

| Family | Source | Rows | File |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `02` | `docs/02-requirements/` | 1325 | [02-requirements](./02-requirements.md) |
| `03` | `docs/03-architecture/` | 0 | [03-architecture](./03-architecture.md) |
| `05` | `docs/05-DATA_CONTRACT.md` | 19 | [05-data-contract](./05-data-contract.md) |
| `07` | `docs/07-design/` | 91 | [07-design](./07-design.md) |
| `CL` | `CLAUDE.md` | 66 | [claude](./claude.md) |

Test IDs referenced in the `Test(s)` column are defined in the
[Test ID Legend](./test-id-legend.md).

## Summary

```text
Total requirements:            1422
Covered (implemented + tested): 763
Implemented, not tested:        659
Gap (no implementation):          0
Orphan tests (no requirement):    0

Note: §113 (Proactive Merge-Queue Enqueue) adds 9 requirements
  (02-§113.1–113.9): 7 covered (ENQ-01..10 in tests/github.test.js plus the
  buildEnqueueMutation parity tests in api/tests/GitHubTest.php) and 2
  implemented (the enqueue call after auto-merge, and keeping auto-merge as a
  complement, both code-review/ENQ-M01 manual). After the form API creates an
  event PR and enables squash auto-merge, it places the PR in the merge queue
  immediately via GraphQL enqueuePullRequest so a submitted activity merges in
  ~50 s instead of waiting for the reactive recovery sweep (~15 min worst case).
  The call is best-effort: when the PR is not yet mergeable (checks still
  running) the failure is logged and the PR falls back to auto-merge plus the
  §112 reactive recovery. ENQ-M01 is the live checkpoint — enqueue cannot be
  exercised without a real token and a real PR, so whether it succeeds at
  submission time (and thus whether the latency goal is actually met) must be
  confirmed against production (#481).

Note: §112 (Stranded Auto-Merge Recovery) adds 15 requirements
  (02-§112.1–112.15): 6 covered (STRAND-01..19,
  tests/stranded-recovery.test.js) and 9 implemented (the GraphQL
  disable→enable toggle, the per-PR isolation and early-exit in main(), the two
  workflow entry points, the EVENT_AUTOMERGE_TOKEN auth, and the deploy-trigger
  identity, STRAND-M01 manual). Event PRs merge through a
  required merge queue; when main advances between auto-merge enablement and
  queue entry, a sibling event PR can strand (auto-merge on, mergeStateStatus
  CLEAN, no mergeQueueEntry) and never merge. recover-stranded-event-prs.js
  detects that signature and toggles auto-merge off then on to register a fresh
  queue entry, running after each event merge and on a 15-minute safety-net
  schedule (#495). The toggle uses EVENT_AUTOMERGE_TOKEN because the default
  GITHUB_TOKEN cannot run the auto-merge mutations, and the sweep exits non-zero
  when any stranded PR could not be recovered (#496-followup).

Note: §111 (Duplicate Submission Hardening) adds 9 requirements
  (02-§111.1–111.9): 7 covered (DEDUP-01..09, DEDUPCLEAN-01..09,
  tests/dedup-submission.test.js + tests/dedup-cleanup.test.js, plus PHPUnit
  parity) and 2 implemented (the gh-CLI PR close + the workflow job, DEDUP-M02
  manual). A duplicate add (same title+date+start → same fragment path) is
  rejected by a synchronous pre-check against main (HTTP 409, Swedish "Den här
  aktiviteten finns redan i schemat.") before any branch is created, refining
  02-§109.8 and replacing the 422 "skrivkonflikt" path. The pre-check covers
  single and batch add and runs before the response in both runtimes. A
  concurrent duplicate that slips past the pre-check is auto-closed by
  close-redundant-event-prs after the first merges, when its net diff against
  main is empty; a same-id/different-body collision is logged instead of closed
  (#480).

Note: §109 (Concurrent Event Submission via Fragment Files) adds 26
  requirements (02-§109.1–109.26): 22 covered, 4 implemented. Each submitted
  event is written as its own file under source/data/<stem>/<id>.yaml instead
  of being appended to the shared camp YAML, so concurrent submissions never
  touch the same file and their PRs cannot conflict in the merge queue (fixes
  #461). loadCampEvents() (FRAG-01..09) merges the camp file with its fragments
  for every view; buildFragmentYaml/fragmentPath/assertFragmentYamlValid
  (FRAG-30..43, PHP parity) write fragments; validateFragment + check-yaml-
  security fragment scan (FRAG-60..66, FRAG-80..82) validate them; campFileForPath
  (FRAG-50..58, EDW-29..32) maps fragment paths back to a camp for deploy QA
  gating and PR-check validation. Edit and delete operate only on fragment files
  and never rewrite the camp YAML (#467, FRAGONLY-01..12, Node+PHP); the live
  June camp's events are split into one fragment each. The 4 implemented rows are
  the network add orchestration (manual/e2e checkpoints). Splitting a seeded camp
  into fragments when it opens, and compaction back into the camp file after
  archival, are separate follow-ups.

Note: §108 (Config-File QA Deploy Trigger) adds 4 requirements
  (02-§108.1–108.4), all covered by DQT-01..06
  (tests/deploy-qa-config-trigger.test.js). deploy-qa.yml ignores only
  per-camp event files (20[0-9][0-9]-*.yaml, qa-*.yaml), so a change to
  camps.yaml or local.yaml triggers a full QA deploy; production stays
  manual. Refines 02-§40.14.

Note: §107 (Location Availability) adds 8 requirements
  (02-§107.1–107.8), all covered by LOCAVAIL-01..12
  (tests/location-availability.test.js). An optional `active: false`
  field on a local.yaml location removes it from the add/edit form
  dropdowns, the Lokaler schedule grid, and the homepage location
  accordions; the "Annat" fallback always remains in the forms.

Note: §106 (Token Minting from the Web) adds 18 requirements
  (02-§106.1–106.18): 9 covered (MINT-01..15, tests/mint-token.test.js,
  plus PHPUnit MintTokenTest cross-runtime parity) and 9 implemented
  (browser/manual checkpoints for mint-UI visibility, role-driven day
  field, copy/share buttons, and fragment redemption).

Note: §105 (Early Access Role, tidig åtkomst) adds 11 requirements
  (02-§105.1–105.11): 7 covered (EARLY-01..23, tests/early-access.test.js,
  plus PHPUnit AdminTokenTest verifyPreCampBypassToken parity) and 4
  implemented (browser/manual checkpoints for edit-link suppression,
  role-aware bypass labels, ownership message, Swedish text).

Note: §104 (Security Hardening 2026-06) adds 20 requirements
  (02-§104.1–104.20), all covered by SEC-369..387 (tests/security-hardening.test.js)
  and the PHPUnit SecurityHardeningTest. Covers feedback metadata sanitisation,
  render-layer link-protocol validation, constant-time admin-token comparison,
  SESSION_SECRET documentation, trusted-proxy (right-most XFF) + flock rate
  limiting, fail-closed time-gating, the event-data PR validation gate
  (injection-safe), and HTTP security headers (CSP with build-time API-origin
  injection, nosniff, frame, referrer, permissions, HSTS).

Note: §101 (signed session ownership) adds 13 requirements:
  10 covered (SES-16..21, ADED-01..08, PSES-01..03) and 3 implemented
  (browser/manual checkpoints for JavaScript-readable cookie UI hints,
  cleanup/debug-panel behaviour).

Note: §100 (API .env outside web root) adds 11 requirements
  (02-§100.1–100.11): 7 covered (HTACC-01..06, ENVLOC-01..04) and 4
  implemented (02-§100.3/100.6 manual server checkpoints, 02-§100.9/100.10
  structural). §53.12–53.14 (persistent .env backup) are superseded by §100
  and excluded from the totals above (were covered; backup mechanism removed).

Note: Archive timeline implemented (02-§2.6, 02-§16.2, 02-§16.4, 02-§21.1–21.11).
8 of 11 new requirements are covered (ARK-01..08 tests).
§80 multi-day selection: 12 covered by tests, 12 manual (browser-only), 3 code-only.
3 are implemented but require manual/visual verification
  (02-§21.3 layout, 02-§21.5 single-open, 02-§21.7 keyboard).
02-§2.6, 02-§16.2, 02-§16.4 moved from gap to covered.

17 requirements added for add-activity submit UX flow (02-§19.1–19.17).
3 of these are covered (ADD-01..06 test structural HTML: 02-§19.7, 02-§19.17, and

  lint-yaml.js: unique (title+date+start) combo, active+archived conflict.
    Tests: LNT-19..23.
  app.js: passes activeCamp to validators for range checking.
16 requirements added for CI linting (02-§32.1–32.8, 02-§33.1–33.8):

  5 implemented (manual/code review): 02-§34.7, 02-§34.10–34.12, 02-§34.14.
  05-§1.2 updated: now references derivation logic instead of manual flag.
  05-§1.3 superseded: active+archived conflict is impossible without active field.
  LNT-22..23 tests removed (active+archived check removed).
  `active` field removed from camps.yaml and data contract.
4 accessibility gaps closed:
  02-§13.2 / 07-§9.2 moved from gap to covered (A11Y-01..09):
    :focus-visible rules added to all interactive elements in style.css.
  02-§13.6 / 07-§9.5 moved from gap to implemented:
    native <details>/<summary> accepted as satisfying ARIA requirement;
    archive accordion already uses explicit aria-expanded/aria-controls.
1 requirement added for compact camp list layout (02-§3.5):
  covered (CL-01..03): CSS presence tests for flex layout, no border, no display: block.
  Manual visual check: open homepage and confirm one-liner layout.

  02-§83.34: cache version bumped to sb-sommar-v3.
02-§91.2 updated: token format corrected from "opaque string (e.g. UUID)"
  to `namn_uuid_epoch` with embedded expiry.
2 requirements added for admin token format (02-§91.29–91.30):
  1 covered (02-§91.29: server-side expiry rejection, ADM-09..10).
  1 implemented (02-§91.30: creation script).
§93 Node rate-limit helper replaced by `express-rate-limit` middleware:
  `source/api/rate-limit.js` and `tests/rate-limit.test.js` deleted;
  `app.js` now uses per-route `rateLimit({...})` instances with
  `trust proxy 'loopback'` and standard `Retry-After` / `RateLimit-*`
  headers. Closes CodeQL `js/missing-rate-limiting` alerts 43/44/45.
  5 rows moved from covered to implemented (manual verification replaces
  removed RL-01..05 unit tests of the now-deleted helper).
21 requirements added for the project documentation site (02-§97.1–97.21):
  Pages now enabled (status `built`, source `main` /docs); 02-§97.1–97.3
    moved from gap to implemented based on the GitHub Pages REST API.
  9 implemented — `docs/_config.yml` enables `jekyll-relative-links`;
    `docs/index.md` is the landing page; `01-CONTRIBUTORS.md` points
    readers at the docs site; no new workflows, dependencies, or
    domain config are introduced.
  2 covered (02-§97.13, 02-§97.14) — `README.md` links to the
    published site above the developer setup section and lists every
    docs/*.md file; `tests/readme-docs-link.test.js` verifies both
    (README-DOCS-01..04).
  4 + 4 new tests across `tests/docs-site-config.test.js` (DOCS-CFG-01..04)
    and `tests/readme-docs-link.test.js` (README-DOCS-01..04).
7 hidden-site requirements added for the documentation site (02-§97.15–97.21):
  6 covered, 1 implemented (the policy declaration §97.18).
  Mirrors §1a's intentionally-hidden policy: `docs/robots.txt`
  (`Disallow: /`) blocks every crawler at the docs site root, and
  `docs/_includes/head-custom.html` injects a noindex/nofollow robots
  meta into every rendered page via the Primer theme's standard hook.
  `docs/index.md` no longer links to `https://sbsommar.se`; it carries
  a project-technical reverse-discoverability banner pointing back to
  the source repo, README, and issue tracker on github.com.
  8 new tests across the same suite (DOCS-CFG-05..07, DOCS-IDX-01..05).

20 requirements delivered for the locale overview page (02-§98.1–98.20,
Session 1 of issue #332): 16 covered by unit tests (LOK-01..83),
4 implemented (§98.8 contextual links, §98.14 design-token discipline,
§98.15 mobile breakpoint, §98.20 corner cell) — all four need
manual/browser verification only. See 02-requirements/design-and-content.md §98 and
07-design/components.md §6 "Locale overview grid" for the design spec.

## Top Gaps — Prioritised Action List

### High — missing whole features

1. **`02-§2.7` / `02-§15.1`–`02-§15.14` / `02-§36.1`–`02-§36.10` — RSS feed + per-event pages** *(resolved)*
   RSS feed at `/schema.rss` and per-event detail pages at `/schema/{id}/`.
   Architecture: `03-architecture/rendering.md §17–18`. Implementation: `render-rss.js`, `render-event.js`.
   22 covered (RSS-01..12, EVT-01..18), 5 implemented (manual/CI config).

### Low — tooling, design, and accessibility gaps

2. **`CL-§5.1` / `02-§32.1`–`02-§32.8` — HTML validation in CI**
    No HTML linter is configured; invalid HTML does not fail the build.
    Requirements added in §32; implementation in progress.

3. **`CL-§5.2` / `02-§33.1`–`02-§33.8` — CSS linting in CI**
    No CSS linter is configured.
    Requirements added in §33; implementation in progress.

4. **`02-§13.2` / `07-§9.2` — Visible focus states** *(resolved)*
    `:focus-visible` rules added to all interactive elements in `style.css`:
    `outline: 2px solid var(--color-terracotta); outline-offset: 2px`.
    Form inputs retain their `:focus` border-color change and gain the outline on `:focus-visible`.

5. **`02-§13.6` / `07-§9.5` — Accordion ARIA attributes** *(resolved)*
    Native `<details>/<summary>` elements satisfy the ARIA requirement — browsers expose
    expanded/collapsed state to assistive technology without explicit attributes.
    Custom accordion components (archive timeline) already use explicit `aria-expanded`
    and `aria-controls` (ARK-04, ARK-05). Design doc updated to codify this decision.

6. **`02-§34.1`–`02-§34.14` — Derived active camp** *(resolved)*
   The `active` flag has been removed from `camps.yaml`. The active camp
   is now derived from dates at build and API time. 8 covered (DAC-01..07),
   5 implemented (manual/code review). 05-§1.3 superseded.

11 requirements added for descriptive image filenames (02-§68.1–68.11):
  8 covered (FNM-01..09): naming convention, reference integrity.
  3 implemented (manual): alt-text match, CSS selector update, no content change.
  39 of 51 image files renamed. One alt-text change: RFSBlogo → RFSB logo.
  CSS selector updated: `.content-img[alt="RFSB logo"]`.
