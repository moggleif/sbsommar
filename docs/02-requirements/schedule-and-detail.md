# SB Sommar – Requirements: Schedule and Activity Detail

Schedule views (weekly, today, display), inline activity detail, static per-event pages, RSS, iCal, Markdown rendering of descriptions.

Part of [the requirements index](./index.md). Section IDs (`02-§N.M`) are stable and cited from code; they do not encode the file path.

---

## 4. Schedule Views

### Weekly schedule

- Shows all activities for the full camp week (Sunday–Sunday). <!-- 02-§4.1 -->
- Activities are grouped by day. <!-- 02-§4.10 -->
- Within each day, activities are listed in chronological order. <!-- 02-§4.2 -->
- Each activity shows: title, start time, end time, location, responsible person. <!-- 02-§4.3 -->

### Today view (`/idag.html`)

- Shows only today's activities in the standard site layout. <!-- 02-§4.5 -->
- No navigation to other days. This view is always today. <!-- 02-§4.13 -->

### Display view (`/live.html`)

- Shows today's activities on a dark, full-screen layout for shared screens around the camp.
- Must be legible at a distance: dark background, large text, minimal interface chrome. <!-- 02-§4.6 -->
- Must not require any interaction to stay useful — it should be readable at a glance. <!-- 02-§4.7 -->
- Shows no site-level footer. <!-- 02-§4.14 -->
- Shows a live clock of the current time in the sidebar, updated every second. <!-- 02-§4.15 -->
- Shows when events were last updated; the timestamp is embedded at build time and shown below the clock. <!-- 02-§4.16 -->
- Polls `version.json` every 5 minutes and reloads the page automatically if a newer build is detected. <!-- 02-§4.17 -->
- Automatically reloads shortly after midnight to show the new day's events. <!-- 02-§4.18 -->
- The heading shows only the current day and date (e.g. "måndag 26 februari 2026") without a page-title prefix. <!-- 02-§4.19 -->
- The heading is positioned inside the sidebar, not above the event list, so events use the full available height. <!-- 02-§4.20 -->
- The layout is optimised for portrait-orientation screens; event rows are compact to maximise the number of visible events. <!-- 02-§4.21 -->
- The old URL `/dagens-schema.html` serves a redirect page that sends the visitor to `/live.html` via `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` and a JavaScript fallback. <!-- 02-§76.1 -->

### All schedule views

- Activities are always in chronological order. <!-- 02-§11.1 -->
- Overlapping activities are allowed and must remain readable. <!-- 02-§4.8 -->
- Clicking an activity opens its detail view (see §5). <!-- 02-§4.9 -->

---

---

## 5. Inline Activity Detail (Schedule)

When a participant clicks an activity, a detail view must show: <!-- 02-§5.1 -->

- Title
- Date
- Start time
- End time
- Location
- Responsible person
- Full description (only if set)
- Communication link (only if set)

Fields with no value must not appear. <!-- 02-§5.2 --> The user must clearly understand whether
additional information exists beyond what the schedule row shows.

The `owner` and `meta` fields are internal and must never appear in any public view. <!-- 02-§5.3 -->

---

---

## 15. RSS Feed

The activity schedule must be available as an RSS feed at `/schema.rss`. <!-- 02-§15.1 -->

The feed must reflect the current state of the schedule. <!-- 02-§15.2 --> It is intended for
participants who want to follow the schedule in an RSS reader or use it to
integrate the schedule elsewhere.

### 15.1 Feed format

The feed must be valid RSS 2.0 XML. <!-- 02-§15.3 -->

All feed metadata must be in Swedish: <!-- 02-§15.4 -->

- `<title>` — "Schema – {camp name}"
- `<description>` — "Aktivitetsschema för {camp name}"
- `<language>` — `sv`

The feed `<link>` must point to the weekly schedule page using the site's
base URL (e.g. `https://sommar.digitalasynctransparency.com/schema.html`). <!-- 02-§15.5 -->

### 15.2 Feed items

Each event in the active camp must produce one `<item>` in the feed. <!-- 02-§15.6 -->

Each item must include: <!-- 02-§15.7 -->

- `<title>` — event title
- `<link>` — absolute URL to the event's per-event detail page (see §36)
- `<guid isPermaLink="true">` — same URL as `<link>`
- `<description>` — a structured, multi-line human-readable summary formatted
  as follows: <!-- 02-§15.15 -->
  - Line 1: formatted date, start–end time (no labels)
  - Line 2: `Plats:` value ` · ` `Ansvarig:` value (with labels)
  - Line 3: event description (only if set, no label)
  - Line 4: event link (only if set, no label)
- `<pubDate>` — the event date and start time, formatted as RFC 822

Items must be sorted chronologically (same order as the weekly schedule). <!-- 02-§15.8 -->

### 15.3 Build-time generation

The RSS feed is generated at build time by `render-rss.js` and written to
`public/schema.rss`. <!-- 02-§15.9 -->

The renderer must not depend on any RSS library — the XML is simple enough
to emit directly. <!-- 02-§15.10 -->

### 15.4 Site base URL

Absolute URLs in the RSS feed (and per-event detail pages) require a
configurable base URL. <!-- 02-§15.11 -->

The build reads the base URL from the `SITE_URL` environment variable. <!-- 02-§15.12 -->

If `SITE_URL` is not set, the build must fail with a clear error message —
RSS links cannot be generated without a base URL. <!-- 02-§15.13 -->

CI workflows that run `npm run build` must pass `SITE_URL` as an
environment variable alongside `API_URL`. <!-- 02-§15.14 -->

---

---

## 36. Static Per-Event Pages

Each event in the active camp must have its own static HTML page, generated
at build time. <!-- 02-§36.1 -->

### 36.1 URL structure

Each event page lives in its own sub-folder under `/schema/`: <!-- 02-§36.2 -->

```text
/schema/{event-id}/index.html
```

For example: `/schema/middag-2026-06-30-1630/index.html`, accessible as
`/schema/middag-2026-06-30-1630/`.

### 36.2 Page content

Each event page must show: <!-- 02-§36.3 -->

- Event title (as page heading)
- Date (formatted in Swedish)
- Start time and end time
- Location
- Responsible person
- Description (if set)
- External link (if set)

Fields with no value must not appear. <!-- 02-§36.4 -->

The event detail body must use a structured layout matching the RSS
description format (see §15.15): <!-- 02-§36.11 -->

- Line 1: formatted date, start–end time (no labels)
- Line 2: `Plats:` value ` · ` `Ansvarig:` value (with labels)
- Line 3: description text (only if set, no label)
- Line 4: external link (only if set)

This replaces the previous definition-list (`<dl>`) layout.

The `owner` and `meta` fields must never appear on event pages. <!-- 02-§36.5 -->

### 36.3 Layout and navigation

Event pages must use the shared site layout: header navigation, footer,
and stylesheet. <!-- 02-§36.6 -->

Each event page must include a back link to the weekly schedule page. <!-- 02-§36.7 -->

### 36.4 Crawler blocking

Event pages must include the `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
tag, consistent with all other pages. <!-- 02-§36.8 -->

### 36.5 Build integration

Event pages are generated by `render-event.js` and wired into `build.js`. <!-- 02-§36.9 -->

The build must create the `/schema/{event-id}/` directory structure inside
`public/`. <!-- 02-§36.10 -->

---

---

## 45. iCal Calendar Export

The activity schedule must be available as iCalendar (`.ics`) files so
participants can sync events to their phone or desktop calendar. <!-- 02-§45.1 -->

### 45.1 Per-event iCal file

Each event in the active camp must have a static `.ics` file generated at
build time, located alongside the event detail page: <!-- 02-§45.2 -->

```text
/schema/{event-id}/event.ics
```

The `.ics` file must be valid iCalendar format (RFC 5545). <!-- 02-§45.3 -->

Each per-event `.ics` file must include exactly one `VEVENT` with: <!-- 02-§45.4 -->

- `DTSTART` / `DTEND` — event start and end time
- `SUMMARY` — event title
- `LOCATION` — event location
- `DESCRIPTION` — responsible person, followed by description text if set
- `URL` — absolute URL to the event detail page
- `UID` — `{event-id}@{hostname}` (stable, unique)

All times must use floating local format (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` with no `Z`
suffix and no `TZID`) — consistent with the no-timezone policy
(05-§4.5). <!-- 02-§45.5 -->

When `end` is null, `DTEND` must be omitted. <!-- 02-§45.6 -->

The iCal renderer must not depend on any external iCal library — the
format is simple enough to emit directly. <!-- 02-§45.7 -->

### 45.2 Per-event iCal link on event detail page

The event detail page (§36) must include a download link to the per-event
`.ics` file. <!-- 02-§45.8 -->

The link must appear as a third line in the event detail body, after the
existing Plats/Ansvarig line, styled consistently with those
lines. <!-- 02-§45.9 -->

### 45.3 Full-camp iCal feed

A complete iCalendar file containing all events in the active camp must be
generated at build time at `/schema.ics`. <!-- 02-§45.10 -->

The full-camp `.ics` file must contain one `VEVENT` per event, using the
same field mapping as per-event files (§45.4). <!-- 02-§45.11 -->

The `VCALENDAR` must include: <!-- 02-§45.12 -->

- `PRODID` — identifies the generator (e.g. `-//SB Sommar//Schema//SV`)
- `X-WR-CALNAME` — `Schema – {camp name}`
- `METHOD` — `PUBLISH`

### 45.4 Webcal link on schedule page

The weekly schedule page must include a webcal subscription link to the
full-camp iCal feed, alongside the existing RSS link. <!-- 02-§45.13 -->

The link must use the `webcal://` protocol scheme (replacing `https://` in
the site URL). <!-- 02-§45.14 -->

### 45.5 Calendar tips page

A static page must exist at `/kalender.html`. <!-- 02-§45.15 -->

The page must include step-by-step instructions for subscribing to the
camp calendar on: iOS Calendar, Android / Google Calendar, Gmail (web),
and Outlook. <!-- 02-§45.16 -->

The page must explain the difference between subscribing to the full camp
calendar (auto-updates) and downloading individual event files
(one-time import). <!-- 02-§45.17 -->

The page must be written in Swedish. <!-- 02-§45.18 -->

The page must use the shared site layout: header, navigation, and
footer. <!-- 02-§45.19 -->

### 45.6 Build integration

The iCal renderer must be a separate module (`render-ical.js`), following
the same pattern as `render-rss.js`. <!-- 02-§45.20 -->

The tips page renderer must be a separate module
(`render-kalender.js`). <!-- 02-§45.21 -->

Both must be wired into `build.js`. <!-- 02-§45.22 -->

iCal generation reuses the existing `SITE_URL` environment variable — no
new configuration is needed. <!-- 02-§45.23 -->

---

---

## 46. iCal Presentation and Compliance

### 46.1 Schedule page calendar icon

The schedule page header displays a calendar icon that links to the
calendar tips page (`kalender.html`). <!-- 02-§46.4 -->

The icon is an inline SVG, matching the RSS icon height
(38 px). <!-- 02-§46.1 -->

No text label accompanies the icon — the title attribute and visual
design provide sufficient affordance. <!-- 02-§46.3 -->

### 46.2 Per-event iCal link in schedule rows

Every event row on the weekly schedule page includes a download link to
its `.ics` file. <!-- 02-§46.5 -->

The link appears at the end of the row, after location and responsible
metadata, as a small text link labelled "iCal". <!-- 02-§46.6 -->

It is styled consistently with `.ev-meta` (small font, terracotta colour)
and does not disrupt the existing row layout. <!-- 02-§46.7 -->

The link uses the `download` attribute so the browser saves the file
rather than navigating. <!-- 02-§46.8 -->

### 46.3 Calendar tips page discoverability

The weekly schedule page includes a visible link to `kalender.html` near
the header or intro text so users can find instructions for subscribing
to the calendar. <!-- 02-§46.9 -->

### 46.4 Calendar tips page layout

The calendar tips page uses the card-based layout style used elsewhere on
the site (white background, rounded corners, card shadow, sage left
border). <!-- 02-§46.11 -->

Each platform section (iOS, Android, Gmail, Outlook) is visually
separated as its own card or clearly delineated
section. <!-- 02-§46.12 -->

The webcal URL is displayed in a copy-friendly code block styled
consistently with existing code blocks on the site. <!-- 02-§46.13 -->

### 46.5 DTSTAMP in VEVENT blocks

Every `VEVENT` block in both per-event and full-camp `.ics` files
includes a `DTSTAMP` property (RFC 5545 §3.6.1). <!-- 02-§46.14 -->

The value is a UTC timestamp representing the build time, formatted as
`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`. <!-- 02-§46.15 -->

---

---

## 56. Render Description as Markdown

The `description` field in event YAML files may contain Markdown syntax
(parsed by `marked`, the same library used for `content/*.md`). All
rendering paths must treat the description as Markdown and produce
appropriate output for each context.

### 56.1 Site requirements

- In the event detail page, the description must be rendered as formatted
  HTML produced by `marked.parse()`. <!-- 02-§56.1 -->
- In the weekly schedule (schema.html), the description inside the
  expandable event row must be rendered as formatted HTML produced by
  `marked.parse()`. <!-- 02-§56.2 -->
- In the today view (idag.html / live.html), the description
  must be rendered as formatted HTML. The HTML must be pre-rendered at
  build time and delivered in the JSON payload to avoid shipping the
  `marked` library to the client. <!-- 02-§56.3 -->
- In the RSS feed (schema.rss), the description must be stripped of
  Markdown syntax and included as plain text in the `<description>`
  element. <!-- 02-§56.4 -->
- In iCal output (schema.ics and per-event .ics files), the description
  must be stripped of Markdown syntax and included as plain text in the
  `DESCRIPTION` property. <!-- 02-§56.5 -->
- Raw HTML in description Markdown is dropped at parse time by marked
  renderer overrides, so `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`,
  any other raw tags, and any `on*` event-handler attributes never appear
  in the rendered output. URIs in links and images that use the
  `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`, or `file:` scheme — matched
  case-insensitively and tolerant of leading whitespace and control
  characters — are neutralized to an empty `href`/`src`. <!-- 02-§56.6 -->
- Descriptions that contain no Markdown syntax (plain text) must continue
  to render correctly — `marked` wraps them in `<p>` tags, which is
  acceptable. <!-- 02-§56.7 -->
- The `.event-description p` rule must no longer apply `font-style:
  italic`, so that Markdown emphasis renders distinctly. <!-- 02-§56.8 -->
- CSS for rendered descriptions must use existing design tokens from
  `07-DESIGN.md`. No new custom properties are introduced. <!-- 02-§56.9 -->
- A shared build-time helper must provide both `renderDescriptionHtml()`
  and `stripMarkdown()` to avoid duplicating Markdown processing logic
  across render modules. <!-- 02-§56.10 -->

## 59. Scoped Heading Sizes in Event Descriptions

### Context

The global heading styles (h1 = 40 px, h2 = 35 px, h3 = 30 px) are designed
for page-level headings.  When Markdown descriptions containing headings are
rendered inside event cards (`.event-desc`, `.event-description`) and the
Markdown preview (`.md-preview`), those page-level sizes are applied,
producing oversized headings and — in `.md-preview` where only h2 was
overridden — a broken size hierarchy where h3 appears larger than h2.

### 59.1 Heading size requirements

- Headings h1–h4 inside `.md-preview`, `.event-desc`, and
  `.event-description` must be visually smaller than the global page
  headings and must follow a strictly decreasing size
  order (h1 > h2 > h3 > h4). <!-- 02-§59.1 -->
- The scoped sizes must use relative `em` units so they scale with the
  container's font-size context (e.g. 13 px in `.event-extra` vs
  16 px in `.md-preview`). <!-- 02-§59.2 -->
- h4 must be the same size as body text but bold, to provide a clear
  lower-bound heading level. <!-- 02-§59.3 -->
- All scoped heading styles must use existing design tokens or plain
  `em` values — no hardcoded pixel sizes. <!-- 02-§59.4 -->

### 59.2 Markdown guide link

- The help link in the Markdown preview header must point to a
  beginner-friendly guide (`https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/`),
  not a library API reference. <!-- 02-§59.5 -->
- The link text and URL must be identical in `/lagg-till.html` and
  `/redigera.html`. <!-- 02-§59.6 -->
