# SB Sommar – Requirements: Platform and Security

Cross-cutting platform concerns: reliability, accessibility, Swedish language, security hardening, analytics, feedback, PWA, admin token, rate limiting.

Part of [the requirements index](./index.md). Section IDs (`02-§N.M`) are stable and cited from code; they do not encode the file path.

---

## 12. Reliability

Participants must be able to trust that:

- The schedule reflects the current plan.
- A newly submitted activity appears in the schedule within a few minutes. <!-- 02-§12.1 -->
- Corrections and removals made by an admin are visible in all schedule views. <!-- 02-§12.2 -->
- All event submissions are permanently recorded in Git history as a full audit trail. <!-- 02-§12.3 -->

The schedule is a shared coordination tool during the camp week.

---

---

## 13. Accessibility

The site must meet WCAG AA as a baseline:

- Color contrast must be at least `4.5:1` for body text. <!-- 02-§13.1 -->
- All interactive elements must have visible focus states. <!-- 02-§13.2 -->
- Navigation must be fully keyboard accessible. <!-- 02-§13.3 -->
- Images must have descriptive `alt` text. <!-- 02-§13.4 -->
- The add-activity form must be usable without a mouse. <!-- 02-§13.5 -->
- Accordion or expandable elements must use proper ARIA attributes. <!-- 02-§13.6 -->

---

---

## 14. Language

The site is written entirely in Swedish. <!-- 02-§14.1 -->

This includes: all page content, navigation labels, form labels, error messages,
confirmation messages, and accessibility text (alt, aria-label, etc.).

---

---

## 39. CodeQL Alert Remediation

GitHub CodeQL static analysis reports six alerts across workflows, server code,
and test files. All must be resolved so the repository reaches zero open CodeQL
alerts.

### 39.1 Workflow permissions (CI)

- `ci.yml` must declare an explicit `permissions` block with minimal
  scope. The workflow only reads repository contents, so `contents: read`
  is sufficient. <!-- 02-§39.1 -->

### 39.2 Workflow permissions (deploy)

- `deploy-reusable.yml` must declare an explicit `permissions` block with
  minimal scope. The workflow reads repository contents and deploys the
  main site (`sbsommar.se`) to external shared hosting via FTP/SSH, so
  `contents: read` is sufficient and no write-scoped token such as
  `pages: write` is needed. The GitHub Pages documentation site (§97) is
  served directly by GitHub from the `docs/` folder and uses its own
  built-in deployment, unaffected by this workflow's permissions. <!-- 02-§39.2 -->

### 39.3 ReDoS-safe slugify

- The `slugify()` function in `source/api/github.js` must not contain
  regex patterns that CodeQL flags as polynomial-time backtracking risks.
  The current `/^-+|-+$/g` alternation must be replaced with an equivalent
  that avoids backtracking. <!-- 02-§39.3 -->
- The replacement must produce identical output for all existing test
  cases. <!-- 02-§39.4 -->

### 39.4 Test assertion specificity

- Test assertions that check for URL substrings must be specific enough
  that CodeQL does not flag them as incomplete URL sanitisation. <!-- 02-§39.5 -->
- Assertions in `tests/render.test.js` and `tests/github.test.js` that
  use bare `includes('https://…')` must be changed to match a surrounding
  context (e.g. `includes('href="https://…"')` or
  `includes('link: https://…')`). <!-- 02-§39.6 -->

### 39.5 Verification

- After the changes are merged, `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts?state=open`
  must return fewer open alerts (ideally zero). <!-- 02-§39.7 -->

---

---

## 49. API-Layer Security Validation

The event security scan (injection patterns, link protocol, length limits) currently
runs only in CI as a post-commit check. This means malicious payloads can reach the
git repository before being caught. Moving these checks into the API request
validation layer rejects dangerous input at submission time — before any data is
written to git.

This change does not remove the existing CI security scan; it adds an earlier,
identical check. The CI scan will be removed in a future pipeline optimisation.

### 49.1 Injection pattern scanning in the API

- The API request validation (`validateEventRequest` / `validateEditRequest`) must
  scan the free-text fields `title`, `location`, `responsible`, and `description`
  for injection patterns before accepting the request. <!-- 02-§49.1 -->
- The following patterns must be rejected (case-insensitive): `<script`, `javascript:`,
  event handler attributes (`on*=`), `<iframe`, `<object`, `<embed`,
  `data:text/html`. <!-- 02-§49.2 -->
- A request containing any injection pattern must be rejected with an error message
  identifying the offending field and pattern category. <!-- 02-§49.3 -->

### 49.2 Link protocol validation in the API

- When the `link` field is a non-empty string, the API must verify that it starts
  with `http://` or `https://` (case-insensitive). Any other protocol or a missing
  protocol must be rejected. <!-- 02-§49.4 -->

### 49.3 Parity between Node.js and PHP implementations

- The injection patterns and link protocol checks must be implemented identically
  in both `source/api/validate.js` and `api/src/Validate.php`. <!-- 02-§49.5 -->
- Both implementations must produce equivalent error messages for the same
  invalid input. <!-- 02-§49.6 -->

---

---

## 63. Site Analytics

The site needs usage analytics to answer questions about traffic, visitor
behaviour, and content effectiveness. Analytics must respect the static-site,
no-backend, minimal-JS constraints.

### 63.1 Tool choice

- The analytics tool must be GoatCounter (hosted, free tier). <!-- 02-§63.1 -->
- No cookies may be set by the analytics tool. <!-- 02-§63.2 -->
- The analytics script must be lightweight (< 5 KB). <!-- 02-§63.3 -->

### 63.2 Environment scope

- Analytics must be collected in both production and QA
  environments. <!-- 02-§63.4 -->
- Each environment uses its own GoatCounter site code so data is kept
  separate. <!-- 02-§63.5 -->
- Local development must not send analytics data (environment variable
  left unset). <!-- 02-§63.6 -->

### 63.3 Script inclusion

- The GoatCounter script tag must be included on every page that uses the
  shared site layout (header/footer pages). <!-- 02-§63.7 -->
- The display view (`/live.html`) must also include the analytics
  script, even though it has no shared layout. <!-- 02-§63.8 -->
- The script must load asynchronously and must not block page
  rendering. <!-- 02-§63.9 -->
- The GoatCounter site code must be configurable via an environment variable
  (`GOATCOUNTER_SITE_CODE`) so it is not hardcoded in source. <!-- 02-§63.10 -->
- When the environment variable is not set (local dev), the script tag must
  not be rendered. <!-- 02-§63.11 -->

### 63.4 Basic traffic (automatic)

GoatCounter provides these automatically — no custom code required:

- Page views per day/week. <!-- 02-§63.12 -->
- Most visited pages. <!-- 02-§63.13 -->
- Referrer tracking. <!-- 02-§63.14 -->
- Device type and screen size. <!-- 02-§63.15 -->
- Returning visitors. <!-- 02-§63.16 -->
- 404 hits. <!-- 02-§63.17 -->
- Page load times. <!-- 02-§63.18 -->
- Traffic patterns over time (before/during/after camp). <!-- 02-§63.19 -->

### 63.5 Custom events (behaviour tracking)

The following interactions must be tracked as GoatCounter custom events:

- Activity form submission (successful). <!-- 02-§63.20 -->
- Activity form abandonment (cancel/navigate away). <!-- 02-§63.21 -->
- Today view page load. <!-- 02-§63.22 -->
- Display mode page load. <!-- 02-§63.23 -->
- Click on Discord link. <!-- 02-§63.24 -->
- Click on Facebook link. <!-- 02-§63.25 -->
- iCal file download. <!-- 02-§63.26 -->
- RSS feed link click. <!-- 02-§63.27 -->
- Scroll depth on schedule pages (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %). <!-- 02-§63.28 -->

### 63.6 QR code referrer tracking

- A data file in the repository (`source/data/qr-codes.yaml`) must list all
  QR code identifiers. <!-- 02-§63.29 -->
- The file is maintained manually — new rows are added when new QR codes are
  printed. <!-- 02-§63.30 -->
- Each QR code entry must have at minimum an `id` and a `description`
  field. <!-- 02-§63.31 -->
- QR code URLs must include the identifier as a query parameter (e.g.
  `?ref=qr-affisch-01`) so GoatCounter records it as a distinct
  referrer. <!-- 02-§63.32 -->
- The existing QR code on the display view sidebar must use a tracked
  referrer parameter from the QR codes data file. <!-- 02-§63.33 -->

### 63.7 Constraints

- No personal data may be collected. <!-- 02-§63.34 -->
- No cookie consent banner is needed (GoatCounter is cookieless). <!-- 02-§63.35 -->
- The analytics implementation must not increase the total JS payload
  beyond what GoatCounter itself requires (no wrapper libraries). <!-- 02-§63.36 -->
- Custom event tracking must use HTML `data-goatcounter-click` attributes
  where possible, minimising inline JavaScript. <!-- 02-§63.37 -->
- All deploy workflows that build site pages must pass
  `GOATCOUNTER_SITE_CODE` to the build step so that rebuilt pages retain
  the analytics script. <!-- 02-§63.38 -->

---

---

## 73. Feedback Button (GitHub Issues)

A discreet feedback button in the navigation bar lets any visitor submit
feedback that is automatically created as a GitHub Issue. The feature
uses the same API patterns as add-event (Node.js + PHP dual
implementation) and the same GitHub API primitives.

### 73.1 User requirements

- A feedback icon button (speech-bubble SVG, no text label) must be
  visible on every page. On mobile it is fixed at the top-right corner
  (`position: fixed; top: var(--space-xs); right: var(--space-sm)`);
  on desktop it is positioned near the content column
  edge. <!-- 02-§73.1 -->
- Clicking the button must open a modal dialog. <!-- 02-§73.2 -->
- The modal must contain a form with the following fields: <!-- 02-§73.3 -->
  - Category (radio buttons): Bugg, Förslag, Övrigt — mapping to GitHub
    labels `feedback:bug`, `feedback:suggestion`, `feedback:other`.
  - Title (required, max 200 characters).
  - Description (required, max 2 000 characters).
  - Name / contact info (optional, max 200 characters).
- On successful submission the modal must show a confirmation message
  with a clickable link to the created GitHub Issue (opens in new
  tab). <!-- 02-§73.4 -->
- On failure the modal must show an error message with a retry
  option. <!-- 02-§73.5 -->
- The modal must show progress steps during submission, following the
  same pattern as the add-event modal. <!-- 02-§73.6 -->

### 73.2 API requirements

- A `POST /feedback` endpoint (Node.js) and `POST /api/feedback`
  endpoint (PHP) must accept the feedback form data. <!-- 02-§73.7 -->
- The API must create a GitHub Issue with: <!-- 02-§73.8 -->
  - Title: `[Feedback] {category}: {title}`
  - Body: description text followed by a metadata table containing
    category, page URL, viewport size, timestamp (ISO 8601), name/contact
    (or "Ej angivet"), and User-Agent.
  - Labels: `feedback:bug`, `feedback:suggestion`, or `feedback:other`
    depending on the selected category.
- The API must return `{ success: true, issueUrl: "<URL>" }` on success
  so the client can link to the created issue. <!-- 02-§73.9 -->
- In local development (when `BUILD_ENV` is neither `production` nor
  `qa`), the API must not create a GitHub Issue. It must log the request
  and return `{ success: true, issueUrl: "" }` (empty
  string). <!-- 02-§73.28 -->
- In the QA environment (`BUILD_ENV` is `qa`), the API must create a
  GitHub Issue just as in production, so that testers can give
  feedback. <!-- 02-§73.29 -->

### 73.3 Validation requirements

- Client-side: title and description are required; submit button is
  disabled until both are filled; length limits are enforced
  visually. <!-- 02-§73.10 -->
- Server-side: title (≤ 200), description (≤ 2 000), name (≤ 200)
  length limits must be enforced. <!-- 02-§73.11 -->
- Server-side: the same injection-pattern scan as §49 must be applied
  to title, description, and name fields. <!-- 02-§73.12 -->
- A honeypot field ("website", hidden from users) must be included. If
  filled, the API returns `200 OK` with `{ success: true }` but does
  not create an issue. <!-- 02-§73.13 -->
- Rate-limiting: max 5 requests per IP per hour (in-memory in Node.js,
  simplest possible in PHP). <!-- 02-§73.14 -->

### 73.4 Accessibility requirements

- The modal must use `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and a
  focus trap. <!-- 02-§73.15 -->
- The button must have `aria-label="Ge feedback"`. <!-- 02-§73.16 -->
- The modal must be closable with Escape, click outside, or a close
  button. <!-- 02-§73.17 -->
- All form fields must have associated `<label>` elements and
  `aria-required` where applicable. <!-- 02-§73.18 -->

### 73.5 Metadata collection

- The form must silently collect and include in the API request: page
  URL, viewport size (width × height), User-Agent string, and timestamp
  (ISO 8601). <!-- 02-§73.19 -->

### 73.6 Implementation parity

- The Node.js and PHP implementations must validate identically and
  produce equivalent error messages. <!-- 02-§73.20 -->
- Both must use the existing `githubRequest()` / `githubRequest()`
  primitives for the GitHub Issues API call. <!-- 02-§73.21 -->

### 73.7 Clarity requirements

- The modal heading must be "Feedback om hemsidan" so visitors
  understand the feedback concerns the website, not the
  camp. <!-- 02-§73.22 -->
- A short help text must appear below the heading: "Gäller hemsidan
  och informationen här, inte själva
  lägret." <!-- 02-§73.23 -->

### 73.8 Local environment warning

- When the API returns a successful response without an issue URL
  (dry-run in local development), the success view must show a
  warning below the "Tack för din feedback!" heading. <!-- 02-§73.24 -->
- The warning text must be: "OBS: Detta är en testsida. Din feedback
  sparades inte. Besök den riktiga siten för att skicka
  feedback." <!-- 02-§73.25 -->
- The warning must use the same styling as form validation errors
  (`.form-error-msg`: terracotta left border, light background). <!-- 02-§73.26 -->
- The warning must not include a URL to the production site. <!-- 02-§73.27 -->

---

## 83. Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

The site must be installable as a Progressive Web App so participants can add it
to their home screen and use it in a standalone app-like experience. A service
worker provides offline caching so that core pages and recent event data remain
accessible without network connectivity.

### 83.1 Web App Manifest (site requirements)

- The build must produce an `app.webmanifest` file at the site root. <!-- 02-§83.1 -->
- The manifest must set `name` to `"SB Sommar"` and `short_name` to
  `"SB Sommar"`. <!-- 02-§83.2 -->
- The manifest must set `display` to `"standalone"`. <!-- 02-§83.3 -->
- The manifest must set `start_url` to `"/"`. <!-- 02-§83.4 -->
- The manifest must set `theme_color` and `background_color` to values from
  the design palette (`07-DESIGN.md §2`). <!-- 02-§83.5 -->
- The manifest must declare at least two icon sizes: 192×192 and
  512×512, both PNG. <!-- 02-§83.6 -->
- The manifest `icons` array must include a `"purpose": "any"` entry. <!-- 02-§83.7 -->
- The manifest `icons` array must include at least one entry with
  `"purpose": "maskable"` so the icon renders correctly in adaptive icon
  contexts (Android home screen, etc.). <!-- 02-§83.26 -->

### 83.2 HTML head tags (site requirements)

- Every HTML page must include `<link rel="manifest" href="app.webmanifest">`
  in `<head>`. <!-- 02-§83.8 -->
- Every HTML page must include `<meta name="theme-color">` with the same value
  as the manifest `theme_color`. <!-- 02-§83.9 -->
- Every HTML page must include `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable"
  content="yes">`. <!-- 02-§83.10 -->
- Every HTML page must include `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style"
  content="default">`. <!-- 02-§83.11 -->
- Every HTML page must include `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="images/sbsommar-icon-192.png">`. <!-- 02-§83.12 -->

### 83.3 Service worker (site requirements)

- The build must produce a `sw.js` file at the site root. <!-- 02-§83.13 -->
- A registration script must be included on every page and must register
  `sw.js` only when the browser supports service workers. <!-- 02-§83.14 -->
- The service worker must use a versioned cache name so that updates can
  invalidate old caches. <!-- 02-§83.15 -->
- On `install`, the service worker pre-caches all site assets (HTML
  pages, CSS, JS, images, `events.json`) so the full site is available
  offline from the first launch. The pre-cache list is generated at
  build time (see §92). <!-- 02-§83.16 -->
- On `fetch`, the service worker must serve cached responses for navigation
  and static-asset requests when the network is unavailable
  (network-first with cache fallback for HTML, cache-first for CSS/JS/images). <!-- 02-§83.17 -->
- On `activate`, the service worker must delete caches whose name does not
  match the current version. <!-- 02-§83.18 -->
- The service worker does not cache API responses (`/api/` paths) or
  form-submission endpoints (`/add-event`, `/edit-event`,
  `/delete-event`, `/verify-admin`). Form pages (`lagg-till.html`,
  `redigera.html`) are pre-cached and served offline; an offline guard
  (§92) disables submission when there is no network. <!-- 02-§83.19 -->
- The service worker must only handle requests with `http:` or `https:`
  schemes; all other schemes (e.g. `chrome-extension:`) must be
  ignored. <!-- 02-§83.27 -->
- The service worker must cache `events.json` using a
  network-first strategy with cache fallback so that schedule data is
  available offline. <!-- 02-§83.28 -->
- When a navigation request fails and the requested page is not in the
  cache, the service worker must respond with a dedicated offline
  fallback page (`/offline.html`) that tells the user they are offline
  and lists which pages may be available from cache. <!-- 02-§83.29 -->

### 83.4 Icon assets (site requirements)

- PNG icon files `sbsommar-icon-192.png` (192×192) and `sbsommar-icon-512.png` (512×512) must
  exist in the images directory. <!-- 02-§83.20 -->
- The build copies them to `public/images/` alongside other image
  assets. <!-- 02-§83.21 -->

### 83.6 Offline fallback page (site requirements)

- The build must produce an `offline.html` page at the site root. <!-- 02-§83.30 -->
- The offline page must use the same shared layout (header, footer,
  CSS) as other pages. <!-- 02-§83.31 -->
- The offline page must display a Swedish-language message informing the
  user that they are offline. <!-- 02-§83.32 -->
- The offline page must only link to pages that are pre-cached and
  functional offline. It must not link to pages that require network
  (e.g. `lagg-till.html`). <!-- 02-§83.35 -->
- The service worker must pre-cache `offline.html` on install. <!-- 02-§83.33 -->

### 83.7 Implementation constraints

- The service worker is implemented in vanilla JavaScript. <!-- 02-§83.22 -->
- No new npm dependencies are added. <!-- 02-§83.23 -->
- Existing pages and functionality must not break. <!-- 02-§83.24 -->
- Every HTML page must use the PWA icon (`images/sbsommar-icon-192.png`) as
  the browser favicon (`<link rel="icon">`). <!-- 02-§83.25 -->
- The cache version constant is updated when caching behaviour changes,
  so that old caches are invalidated on the next
  activation. <!-- 02-§83.34 -->

---

---

## 84. API Error Messages

When an API call fails, the user must receive an error message that helps them
understand whether the problem is actionable or not.

### 84.1 User requirements

- When submitting an activity fails, the user sees a message that indicates
  the nature of the failure — not just "kunde inte sparas". <!-- 02-§84.1 -->
- The user can distinguish between a temporary problem (try again later) and
  a permanent problem (contact the organiser). <!-- 02-§84.2 -->

### 84.2 Site requirements

- The PHP API classifies GitHub API errors into categories before returning
  them to the client: <!-- 02-§84.3 -->
  - **Authentication** (401/403) — token missing or expired.
  - **Conflict** (409/422) — concurrent write or validation failure.
  - **Rate limit** (403 with rate-limit header, 429) — too many requests.
  - **Network / timeout** — GitHub unreachable.
  - **Other server errors** (5xx) — transient GitHub failure.
- Each category maps to a Swedish user-facing message that tells the user
  whether to retry or contact the organiser. <!-- 02-§84.4 -->
- The classification applies to all three mutation endpoints: `/add-event`,
  `/add-events`, and `/edit-event`. <!-- 02-§84.5 -->
- Error messages must never expose internal details such as tokens, file
  paths, or full stack traces. <!-- 02-§84.6 -->
- The existing client-side code (`lagg-till.js`) already displays
  `json.error` — no client changes are needed. <!-- 02-§84.7 -->

---

## 87. Manifest Metadata for Richer Install UI

Chrome requires additional manifest fields to show a richer install prompt.
Missing fields degrade the install experience or block the install prompt on
newer browser versions.

### 87.1 Manifest identity (site requirements)

- The manifest must set `id` to `"/"`. <!-- 02-§87.1 -->
- The manifest must set `description` to `"Information och aktiviteter för SB Sommar-lägret"`. <!-- 02-§87.2 -->

### 87.2 Manifest screenshots (site requirements)

- The manifest must include a `screenshots` array with at least two
  entries. <!-- 02-§87.3 -->
- One screenshot must have `form_factor` set to `"wide"` with size
  `"1280x720"` and type `"image/png"`. <!-- 02-§87.4 -->
- One screenshot must have `form_factor` set to `"narrow"` with size
  `"750x1334"` and type `"image/png"`. <!-- 02-§87.5 -->
- Screenshot `src` paths must point to files in the `images/` directory
  and must be cache-busted by the existing build pipeline. <!-- 02-§87.6 -->

### 87.3 Constraints

- No new npm dependencies. <!-- 02-§87.7 -->
- Existing tests must continue to pass. <!-- 02-§87.8 -->

---

## 88. PWA Install Guide

Many users — especially on iPhone — do not notice that the site can be
installed as an app. A discreet install button in the top bar helps them
discover this without being intrusive.

### 88.1 Install button in navigation (user requirements)

- The header bar must include an install button alongside the existing
  controls (hamburger menu, scroll-to-top, feedback). <!-- 02-§88.1 -->
- The button must use a recognisable install/download icon, styled
  consistently with the other header buttons. <!-- 02-§88.2 -->
- The button label/tooltip must be in Swedish
  (e.g. "Installera appen"). <!-- 02-§88.3 -->
- The button must appear on all pages (it lives in the shared
  header). <!-- 02-§88.4 -->

### 88.2 Platform-specific behaviour (site requirements)

- On browsers that support the `beforeinstallprompt` event
  (Chrome/Edge on Android and desktop), the button must capture the
  event and trigger the native install prompt when clicked. <!-- 02-§88.5 -->
- After a successful installation (detected via the `appinstalled`
  event), the button must be hidden. <!-- 02-§88.6 -->
- On iOS Safari (detected by user-agent and lack of
  `beforeinstallprompt`), the button must show a tooltip or small
  overlay with the instruction: "Tryck på Dela-ikonen och välj
  'Lägg till på hemskärmen'". <!-- 02-§88.7 -->
- The iOS tooltip must close when the user taps outside it or presses
  Escape. <!-- 02-§88.8 -->
- When the site is already running in standalone mode
  (`display-mode: standalone`), the button must not be rendered at
  all. <!-- 02-§88.9 -->
- On browsers where neither `beforeinstallprompt` nor iOS Safari is
  detected, the button must not be rendered. <!-- 02-§88.10 -->

### 88.3 Persistence (site requirements)

- The button is always visible as long as the platform conditions are
  met — no dismiss logic and no localStorage gating. <!-- 02-§88.11 -->

### 88.4 Constraints

- The install button logic must be implemented in a dedicated vanilla
  JavaScript file (`pwa-install.js`). <!-- 02-§88.12 -->
- CSS must use custom properties from `docs/07-DESIGN.md §7`. <!-- 02-§88.13 -->
- No new npm dependencies. <!-- 02-§88.14 -->
- Existing pages and functionality must not break. <!-- 02-§88.15 -->
- All user-facing text must be in Swedish. <!-- 02-§88.16 -->

## 91. Admin Token — Activation and Status Indicator

### 91.1 Context

The site uses a cookie-based ownership model where each participant can
only edit events they created. During camp, one or two designated
administrators need the ability to edit or delete any event — for example
to correct mistakes, remove duplicates, or update events on behalf of
participants who lost their cookie.

This requirement covers the token infrastructure: storage, activation,
verification, and a visual status indicator. The edit/delete authorisation
behaviour that uses this token is defined in §7, §18, and §89.

### 91.2 Admin tokens (site requirements)

- The server must accept a comma-separated list of valid admin tokens
  via the environment variable `ADMIN_TOKENS`. <!-- 02-§91.1 -->
- Each token follows the format `namn_uuid_epoch`, where `namn` is a
  lowercase identifier for the admin, `uuid` is a v4 UUID, and `epoch`
  is a Unix timestamp (seconds) representing the token's expiry
  date. <!-- 02-§91.2 -->
- A token whose embedded epoch is in the past is rejected server-side
  regardless of whether it appears in `ADMIN_TOKENS`. <!-- 02-§91.29 -->
- The creation script `npm run admin:create` generates a token with
  60 days validity and prints instructions for where to store
  it. <!-- 02-§91.30 -->
- When `ADMIN_TOKENS` is unset or empty, all admin functionality is
  disabled — the site behaves exactly as before. <!-- 02-§91.3 -->

### 91.3 Token verification endpoint (API requirements)

- The API must expose `POST /verify-admin`. <!-- 02-§91.4 -->
- The request body must contain `{ "token": "<string>" }`. <!-- 02-§91.5 -->
- If the token matches any entry in `ADMIN_TOKENS`, the response is
  `200 { "valid": true }`. <!-- 02-§91.6 -->
- If the token does not match, the response is
  `403 { "valid": false }`. <!-- 02-§91.7 -->
- The endpoint enforces the rate limits defined in §93 and performs
  token comparison using constant-time string comparison to prevent
  timing attacks. <!-- 02-§91.8 -->

### 91.4 Admin activation page (user requirements)

- A page at `/admin.html` must allow an administrator to enter their
  token. <!-- 02-§91.9 -->
- The page must contain a single text input and a submit button. <!-- 02-§91.10 -->
- On submit, the page must call `POST /verify-admin` with the entered
  token. <!-- 02-§91.11 -->
- If the server responds with `valid: true`: <!-- 02-§91.12 -->
  - Store the token and the current timestamp in `localStorage` under
    the key `sb_admin`. The stored value is a JSON object:
    `{ "token": "<string>", "activated": <unix-ms> }`.
  - Show a success message (in Swedish).
- If the server responds with `valid: false`: <!-- 02-§91.13 -->
  - Do not store anything.
  - Show an error message (in Swedish).
- The page must use the same layout (header, navigation, footer) as
  other site pages. <!-- 02-§91.14 -->
- The page must not be listed in the site navigation. <!-- 02-§91.15 -->

### 91.5 Token expiry (site requirements)

- A stored admin token is considered expired if more than 30 days
  (2 592 000 000 ms) have passed since the `activated`
  timestamp. <!-- 02-§91.16 -->
- Expiry is checked client-side before any admin-related behaviour. <!-- 02-§91.17 -->
- An expired token is treated as if no token exists — the user must
  re-activate. <!-- 02-§91.18 -->

### 91.6 Footer status indicator (user requirements)

- Every page that includes the shared site footer must display an admin
  status icon when a token exists in `localStorage`. <!-- 02-§91.19 -->
- **No token in `localStorage`**: nothing is displayed. <!-- 02-§91.20 -->
- **Valid token (not expired)**: a filled/locked icon is displayed,
  indicating active admin status. <!-- 02-§91.21 -->
- **Expired token (> 30 days)**: an open/unlocked icon is displayed,
  indicating the token needs renewal. Clicking the icon navigates to
  `/admin.html`. <!-- 02-§91.22 -->
- The icon must be small and unobtrusive — it is not intended for
  regular visitors. <!-- 02-§91.23 -->
- The icon must have a `title` attribute explaining its meaning in
  Swedish (e.g. "Admin aktiv" / "Admin utgången"). <!-- 02-§91.24 -->

### 91.7 Constraints

- All user-facing text must be in Swedish. <!-- 02-§91.25 -->
- CSS must use custom properties from `docs/07-DESIGN.md §7`. <!-- 02-§91.26 -->
- The activation page must be accessible (keyboard-navigable,
  screen-reader friendly). <!-- 02-§91.27 -->
- The admin token must never be sent in cookies — it is stored only in
  `localStorage` and sent explicitly in API request bodies or
  headers. <!-- 02-§91.28 -->

## 92. PWA Full Pre-Cache and Offline Guard

The PWA pre-caches every asset the build produces so the entire site works
offline from the first launch after installation. Form pages and the feedback
modal detect offline status and clearly communicate that submission requires
an internet connection.

### 92.1 Build-time pre-cache manifest (site requirements)

- The build scans all files in `public/` after all post-processing
  (cache-busting) is complete and generates a pre-cache URL
  list. <!-- 02-§92.1 -->
- The generated list excludes files that are not meaningful to cache:
  `.htaccess`, `robots.txt`, `sw.js`, `version.json`,
  `.ics` files, `.rss` files, and per-event detail pages
  (`schema/*/index.html`). <!-- 02-§92.2 -->
- The build injects the generated list into `sw.js` by replacing a
  placeholder token (`/* __PRE_CACHE_URLS__ */`). <!-- 02-§92.3 -->
- The injected URLs are root-relative paths (e.g. `/images/hero.jpg`,
  `/style.css`). <!-- 02-§92.4 -->
- After injection, `sw.js` contains no remaining placeholder
  tokens. <!-- 02-§92.5 -->

### 92.2 Service worker (site requirements)

- The `PRE_CACHE_URLS` array in `sw.js` is populated by the build-time
  injection. There is no hand-maintained list. <!-- 02-§92.6 -->
- The service worker cache name is defined in §96.1. <!-- 02-§92.7 -->
- The service worker pre-caches all site pages, including
  `lagg-till.html` and `redigera.html`. <!-- 02-§92.8 -->
- The `NO_CACHE_PATTERNS` list contains only API and submission
  endpoints: `/add-event`, `/edit-event`, `/delete-event`,
  `/verify-admin`, `/api/`. It does not contain any `.html`
  pages. <!-- 02-§92.9 -->
- The `cacheFirstThenNetwork` strategy for static assets matches cache
  entries as defined in §96.5. <!-- 02-§92.10 -->
- The network-first strategies match cache entries with
  `{ ignoreSearch: true }` as defined in §96.6. <!-- 02-§92.11 -->

### 92.3 Offline guard — form pages (user requirements)

- A client-side script `offline-guard.js` detects offline status using
  `navigator.onLine` and the `online`/`offline` events. <!-- 02-§92.12 -->
- When the user is offline on `lagg-till.html` or `redigera.html`, an
  alert banner appears at the top of the form area with the message:
  *"Du är offline. Formuläret kräver internetanslutning för att
  skicka."* <!-- 02-§92.13 -->
- When the user is offline, all submit buttons on the form page are
  disabled (`disabled` attribute set). <!-- 02-§92.14 -->
- When the user comes back online, the banner disappears and the submit
  buttons are re-enabled. <!-- 02-§92.15 -->
- The banner uses the existing `.form-error-msg` styling from the design
  system. <!-- 02-§92.16 -->
- The script is included on `lagg-till.html` and
  `redigera.html`. <!-- 02-§92.17 -->

### 92.4 Offline guard — feedback modal (user requirements)

- When the feedback modal is open and the user is offline, a warning
  message appears inside the modal:
  *"Du är offline — feedback kan inte skickas just nu."* <!-- 02-§92.18 -->
- The feedback submit button is disabled when offline. <!-- 02-§92.19 -->
- When the user comes back online, the warning disappears and the submit
  button follows its normal enabled/disabled logic (based on field
  validation). <!-- 02-§92.20 -->

### 92.5 Constraints

- All user-facing text is in Swedish. <!-- 02-§92.21 -->
- CSS uses custom properties from `docs/07-DESIGN.md §7`. <!-- 02-§92.22 -->
- No npm dependencies are added. <!-- 02-§92.23 -->
- The service worker is vanilla JavaScript with no external
  libraries. <!-- 02-§92.24 -->
- The offline fallback page (`offline.html`) continues to function as a
  last resort when a page is not in the cache. <!-- 02-§92.25 -->

## 93. Rate Limiting for Authorization Endpoints

### 93.1 Context

The API exposes four `POST` endpoints that either perform authorization
(`/verify-admin`) or accept ownership-gated writes (`/edit-event`,
`/delete-event`), plus the user-feedback channel (`/feedback`). CodeQL
flagged three of these as missing rate limiting (alerts #40, #41, #42,
rule `js/missing-rate-limiting`), which allows an attacker to brute-force
admin tokens or hammer the GitHub write path. The feedback endpoint
already enforces a per-IP rate limit through an in-memory / file-based
counter; this requirement extends the same protection to the remaining
authorization endpoints and consolidates the mechanism into a single
reusable implementation per runtime.

### 93.2 Per-endpoint rate limits (API requirements)

- `/verify-admin` rejects more than **5 requests per IP per hour**
  with HTTP `429` and the Swedish error message "För många
  förfrågningar. Försök igen senare." <!-- 02-§93.1 -->
- `/edit-event` rejects more than **30 requests per IP per hour**
  with HTTP `429` and the same Swedish error message. <!-- 02-§93.2 -->
- `/delete-event` rejects more than **30 requests per IP per hour**
  with HTTP `429` and the same Swedish error message. <!-- 02-§93.3 -->
- `/feedback` continues to reject more than **5 requests per IP per
  hour** with HTTP `429` (no behavior change; see §73.14). <!-- 02-§93.4 -->
- The rate-limit check runs before authorization, validation, and
  time-gating so a throttled client never touches the GitHub API or the
  admin-token comparison path. <!-- 02-§93.5 -->
- The client IP used as the rate-limit key is derived from `req.ip` in
  Node — that is, Express's trust-proxy-aware resolver (see §93.15) —
  and from `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` with `REMOTE_ADDR` fallback in
  PHP. <!-- 02-§93.6 -->

### 93.3 Rate-limit implementation (site requirements)

- Node (`app.js`) uses the `express-rate-limit` middleware. Each guarded
  route has its own `rateLimit({ windowMs, limit, ... })` instance
  configured with the per-endpoint limits in §93.2. Instances are named
  so different endpoints do not share quotas. <!-- 02-§93.7 -->
- The Node feedback handler has its own `rateLimit()` instance with
  `{ windowMs: 3_600_000, limit: 5 }`, preserving the §73.14
  behavior. <!-- 02-§93.8 -->
- PHP (`api/index.php`) calls `SBSommar\RateLimit::isLimited($ip,
  $namespace, $limit, $windowSeconds)` from
  `api/src/RateLimit.php`. Counter state lives in a single JSON file
  under `sys_get_temp_dir()` with namespaced keys so endpoints do not
  share quotas. <!-- 02-§93.9 -->
- The PHP feedback handler uses the shared class. `Feedback::isRateLimited`
  no longer exists as a separate implementation; it delegates to
  `RateLimit::isLimited` with the feedback namespace and
  `{ limit: 5, window: 3600 }`. <!-- 02-§93.10 -->
- Rate-limit state is held in the Node process (by `express-rate-limit`'s
  default in-memory store, which evicts expired entries automatically)
  and in a local JSON file in PHP. Neither runtime coordinates across
  processes. This is acceptable because each deployment uses a single
  Node process or a single shared PHP host. <!-- 02-§93.11 -->

### 93.4 Constraints

- All user-facing error text is in Swedish. <!-- 02-§93.12 -->
- The only new npm runtime dependency permitted for rate limiting is
  `express-rate-limit`, used by `app.js` per §93.7. It is required so
  that CodeQL's `js/missing-rate-limiting` analysis can recognize the
  counter, and so that the Node side gains standard `Retry-After` /
  `RateLimit-*` response headers and automatic store cleanup — properties
  the prior custom helper did not provide. <!-- 02-§93.13 -->
- No new Composer dependencies are added. <!-- 02-§93.14 -->
- On the Node side, `app.js` sets Express `trust proxy` to `'loopback'`
  so the middleware only honours `X-Forwarded-For` from trusted
  loopback-connected reverse proxies. On non-loopback deployments the
  trust boundary is the hosting environment's proxy configuration,
  consistent with the existing PHP feedback handler. <!-- 02-§93.15 -->

## 95. Security Hygiene: Regex Performance and Escaping

### 95.1 Context

CodeQL flagged four regex-related issues in the codebase:

- Alert #17 (`js/polynomial-redos`) in `source/api/github.js` at the
  `slugify()` helper — the two-step `.replace(/^-+/, '').replace(/-+$/, '')`
  pass depends on user-provided input and can backtrack polynomially on
  `-`-heavy strings.
- Alerts #30, #31, #32 (`js/incomplete-sanitization`) in
  `tests/scoped-headings.test.js` — the ad-hoc escape
  `.replace(/\./g, '\\.').replace(/\s+/g, '\\s+')` does not cover `\`,
  `*`, `+`, `?`, `^`, `$`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `|`, `[`, `]`, so a
  selector containing any of those characters would produce a malformed
  pattern.

Neither alert represents an active vulnerability — slug inputs come from
authored camp data and the flagged test selectors are hardcoded — but
both should be eliminated so the CodeQL queue stays actionable and future
changes do not silently inherit the unsafe pattern.

### 95.2 Slugify performance (site requirements)

- `slugify()` in `source/api/github.js` strips leading and trailing `-`
  characters in a single linear-time pass so its worst-case time on any
  input is O(n). <!-- 02-§95.1 -->
- `slugify(s)` produces output identical to the previous implementation
  for every input: lowercase, `å`/`ä` → `a`, `ö` → `o`, non-alphanumerics
  collapsed to `-`, leading and trailing `-` removed, truncated to 48
  characters. <!-- 02-§95.2 -->

### 95.3 Regex escape helper (test infrastructure requirements)

- `tests/helpers/regex-escape.js` exports `escapeRegExp(str)` which
  returns `str` with every regex metacharacter in the set
  `. * + ? ^ $ { } ( ) | [ ] \` prefixed by `\`, so the resulting
  pattern matches only the literal input string. <!-- 02-§95.3 -->
- `tests/scoped-headings.test.js` uses `escapeRegExp()` at every site
  where a `container` or `heading` value is interpolated into a
  `RegExp`; the file contains no hand-rolled `\.`/`\s+` substitution for
  regex construction. <!-- 02-§95.4 -->

### 95.4 Constraints

- No new npm or Composer dependencies. <!-- 02-§95.5 -->
- No user-visible behaviour change: slugs generated for new activities
  remain identical to the previous output, so existing event IDs and
  URLs continue to resolve. <!-- 02-§95.6 -->
- CodeQL alerts #17, #30, #31, and #32 reach state `fixed` on the next
  scan after merge. <!-- 02-§95.7 -->

## 96. Self-Healing Service Worker Upgrade

### 96.1 Context

Clients that had visited the site before a deploy could end up serving
a stale `/style.css` from the service worker's Cache Storage even after
a new service worker activated. Two factors combined to cause this:

1. The pre-cache step used `cache.addAll(PRE_CACHE_URLS)` with default
   `fetch` semantics, which respects the browser's HTTP cache. When the
   HTTP cache held a `style.css` copy from before the deploy (served
   with `Cache-Control: max-age=604800`), that stale copy was pulled
   directly into the new `sb-sommar-v<N>` cache.
2. The service worker never called `self.skipWaiting()` or
   `self.clients.claim()`, so a freshly installed worker stayed in the
   waiting state until every existing client was closed. Users who kept
   the site open (especially as an installed PWA) never saw the new
   worker activate.

The result was that CSS changes landed on the server but did not reach
existing clients — the banners added in §94 rendered as unstyled
inline links on devices that had visited the site within the last week.

This section defines the service-worker upgrade behaviour that removes
the need for any user action (no "clear cache and data") to recover
from a stale cache.

### 96.2 Service worker (site requirements)

- The service worker cache name is `sb-sommar-v6`. <!-- 02-§96.1 -->
- The `install` event handler calls `self.skipWaiting()` so that a new
  worker moves straight from `installed` to `activating` without
  waiting for all existing clients to close. <!-- 02-§96.2 -->
- The `install` handler pre-caches every URL in `PRE_CACHE_URLS` using
  `new Request(url, { cache: 'reload' })`, which bypasses the browser's
  HTTP cache and fetches each asset directly from the network, so a
  stale HTTP-cache entry cannot be copied into the service-worker
  cache. <!-- 02-§96.3 -->
- The `activate` event handler deletes every cache whose name is not
  equal to the current `CACHE_NAME` and then calls
  `self.clients.claim()` so that the new worker immediately controls
  every open tab without requiring a reload. <!-- 02-§96.4 -->
- The `cacheFirstThenNetwork` strategy's **primary** cache lookup
  matches without `ignoreSearch`, so a request for
  `style.css?v=<newHash>` does not satisfy from a cache entry keyed at
  `style.css?v=<oldHash>` or `style.css`. When no exact match exists,
  the request falls through to the network and the fresh response is
  stored in the cache. A secondary `ignoreSearch` match is only
  performed as an **offline fallback** when the network fetch itself
  fails, so that pre-cached `/style.css` still serves when the user is
  offline on a new hash. <!-- 02-§96.5 -->
- The `networkFirstThenCache` and `networkFirstWithOfflineFallback`
  strategies continue to use `{ ignoreSearch: true }` when falling back
  to the cache, so that a cache-busted HTML or `events.json` URL still
  matches the previously stored entry during an offline fallback. <!-- 02-§96.6 -->

### 96.3 Pre-cache URL list (site requirements)

- The build-generated `PRE_CACHE_URLS` list continues to contain
  root-relative paths without the cache-busting query string
  (e.g. `/style.css`, not `/style.css?v=abc`). <!-- 02-§96.7 -->
- The cache-first handler, with `ignoreSearch` removed, stores fetched
  `style.css?v=<hash>` responses as separate entries. The pre-cached
  `/style.css` entry continues to serve as an offline fallback when the
  hashed URL is not yet cached. <!-- 02-§96.8 -->

### 96.4 Self-healing behaviour (user requirements)

- A user whose browser has an active service worker from before this
  release receives the new service worker on the next visit to
  `sbsommar.se` (or `qa.sbsommar.se`): the browser fetches `sw.js`
  bypassing its HTTP cache, installs the new worker, applies
  `skipWaiting`, and claims the open tab. <!-- 02-§96.9 -->
- The new worker deletes the old `sb-sommar-v5` cache and rebuilds
  `sb-sommar-v6` from fresh network responses. <!-- 02-§96.10 -->
- After at most one reload following the first post-deploy visit, every
  client sees the same assets that the server serves, including the
  current `style.css` with the §94 registration-banner rules. <!-- 02-§96.11 -->
- No user action (clearing site data, uninstalling the PWA,
  unregistering the service worker) is required to recover from the
  stale-cache state. <!-- 02-§96.12 -->

### 96.5 Constraints

- The service worker remains vanilla JavaScript with no external
  libraries. <!-- 02-§96.13 -->
- No new npm dependencies are added. <!-- 02-§96.14 -->
- The offline behaviour defined in §92 is preserved: form pages and the
  feedback modal continue to show the offline guard when
  `navigator.onLine` is false, and `offline.html` remains the last-resort
  fallback for navigation requests that are not in the cache. <!-- 02-§96.15 -->
